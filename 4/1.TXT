
Preface 
Management books usually deal with managing other people. The 
subject of this book is managing oneself for effectiveness. That one can 
truly manage other people is by no means adequately proven. But one 
can always manage oneself. Indeed, executives who do not manage 
themselves for effectiveness cannot possibly expect to manage their 
associates and subordinates. Management is largely by example. 
Executives who do not know how to make themselves effective in their 
own job and work set the wrong example. 
To be reasonably effective it is not enough for the individual to be 
intelligent, to work hard or to be knowledgeable. Effectiveness is something 
separate, something different. But to be effective also does not 
require special gifts, special aptitude, or special training. Effectiveness 
as an executive demands doing certain—and fairly simple—things. It 
consists of a small number of practices, the practices that are presented 
and discussed in this book. But these practices are not “inborn.” In 
forty-five years of work as a consultant with a large number of executives 
in a wide variety of organizations—large and small; businesses, 
government agencies, labor unions, hospitals, universities, community 
services; American, European, Latin American and Japanese—I have 
not come across a single “natural”: an executive who was born effective. 
All the effective ones have had to learn to be effective. And all of 
them then had to practice effectiveness until it became habit. But all 
the ones who worked on making themselves effective executives succeeded 
in doing so. Effectiveness can be learned—and it also has to be 
learned. 
Effectiveness is what executives are being paid for, whether they 
work as managers who are responsible for the performance of others as?
viii 
well as their own, or as individual professional contributors responsible 
for their own performance only. Without effectiveness there is no “performance,” 
no matter how much intelligence and knowledge goes into 
the work, no matter how many hours it takes. Yet it is perhaps not too 
surprising that we have so far paid little attention to the effective executive. 
Organizations—whether business enterprises, large government 
agencies, labor unions, large hospitals or large universities—are, after 
all, brand new. A century ago almost no one had even much contact 
with such organizations beyond an occasional trip to the local post 
office to mail a letter. And effectiveness as an executive means effectiveness 
in and through an organization. Until recently there was little 
reason for anyone to pay much attention to the effective executive or 
to worry about the low effectiveness of so many of them. Now, however, 
most people—especially those with even a fair amount of schooling—
can expect to spend all their working lives in an organization of 
some kind. Society has become a society of organizations in all developed 
countries. Now the effectiveness of the individual depends 
increasingly on his or her ability to be effective in an organization, to 
be effective as an executive. And the effectiveness of a modern society 
and its ability to perform—perhaps even its ability to survive—depend 
increasingly on the effectiveness of the people who work as executives 
in the organizations. The effective executive is fast becoming a key 
resource for society, and effectiveness as an executive a prime requirement 
for individual accomplishment and achievement—for young 
people at the beginning of their working lives fully as much as for people 
in mid-career.

1: Effectiveness Can Be 
Learned 
To be effective is the job of the executive. “To effect” and “to execute” 
are, after all, near-synonyms. Whether he works in a business 
or in a hospital, in a government agency or in a labor union, 
in a university or in the army, the executive is, first of all, 
expected to get the right things done. And this is simply that he is 
expected to be effective. 
Yet men of high effectiveness are conspicuous by their 
absence in executive jobs. High intelligence is common enough 
among executives. Imagination is far from rare. The level of 
knowledge tends to be high. But there seems to be little correlation 
between a man’s effectiveness and his intelligence, his imagination 
or his knowledge. Brilliant men are often strikingly ineffectual; 
they fail to realize that the brilliant insight is not by itself 
achievement. They never have learned that insights become 
effectiveness only through hard systematic work. Conversely, in 
every organization there are some highly effective plodders. 
While others rush around in the frenzy and busyness which very 
bright people so often confuse with “creativity,” the plodder puts 
one foot in front of the other and gets there first, like the tortoise 
in the old fable. 
Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential 
resources, but only effectiveness converts them into results. By 
themselves, they only set limits to what can be attained.

WHY WE NEED EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVES 
All this should be obvious. But why then has so little attention 
been paid to effectiveness, in an age in which there are 
mountains of books and articles on every other aspect of the 
executive’s tasks? 
One reason for this neglect is that effectiveness is the specific 
technology of the knowledge worker within an organization. 
Until recently, there was no more than a handful of these 
around. 
For manual work, we need only efficiency; that is, the ability 
to do things right rather than the ability to get the right things 
done. The manual worker can always be judged in terms of the 
quantity and quality of a definable and discrete output, such as a 
pair of shoes. We have learned how to measure efficiency and 
how to define quality in manual work during the last hundred 
years—to the point where we have been able to multiply the output 
of the individual worker tremendously. 
Formerly, the manual worker—whether machine operator or 
front-line soldier—predominated in all organizations. Few people 
of effectiveness were needed: those at the top who gave the 
orders that others carded out. They were so small a fraction of 
the total work population that we could, rightly or wrongly, take 
their effectiveness for granted. We could depend on the supply of 
“naturals,” the few people in any area of human endeavor who 
somehow know what the rest of us have to learn the hard way. 
• This was true not only of business and the army. It is hard to 
realize today that “government” during the American Civil 
War a hundred years ago meant the merest handful of people. 
Lincoln’s Secretary of War had fewer than fifty civilian 
subordinates, most of them not “executives” and policy-makers 
but telegraph clerks. The entire Washington establishment 
of the U.S. government in Theodore Roosevelt’s time, 
THE EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVE?
around 1900, could be comfortably housed in any one of the 
government buildings along the Mall today. 
The hospital of yesterday did not know any of the 
“health-service professionals,” the X-ray and lab technicians, 
the dieticians and therapists, the social workers, and so on, of 
whom it now employs as many as two hundred and fifty for 
every one hundred patients. Apart from a few nurses, there 
were only cleaning women, cooks, and maids. The physician 
was the knowledge worker, with the nurse as his aide. 
In other words, up to recent times, the major problem of 
organization was efficiency in the performance of the manual 
worker who did what he had been told to do. Knowledge 
workers were not predominant in organization. 
In fact, only a small fraction of the knowledge workers of 
earlier days were part of an organization. Most of them worked 
by themselves as professionals, at best with a clerk. Their effectiveness 
or lack of effectiveness concerned only themselves and 
affected only themselves. 
Today, however, the large knowledge organization is the central 
reality. Modern society is a society of large organized institutions. 
In every one of them, including the armed services, the 
center of gravity has shifted to the knowledge worker, the man 
who puts to work what he has between his ears rather than the 
brawn of his muscles or the skill of his hands. Increasingly, the 
majority of people who have been schooled to use knowledge, 
theory, and concept rather than physical force or manual skill 
work in an organization and are effective insofar as they can 
make a contribution to the organization. 
Now effectiveness can no longer be taken for granted. Now it 
can no longer be neglected. 
The imposing system of measurements and tests which we 
have developed for manual work—from industrial engineering 
E F F ECTI V ENE S S CAN B E L E A RNED 3?
4
to quality control—is not applicable to knowledge work. There 
are few things less pleasing to the Lord, and less productive, than 
an engineering department that rapidly turns out beautiful blueprints 
for the wrong product. Working on the right things is 
what makes knowledge work effective. This is not capable of 
being measured by any of the yardsticks for manual work. 
The knowledge worker cannot be supervised closely or in 
detail. He can only be helped. But he must direct himself, and he 
must direct himself toward performance and contribution, that 
is, toward effectiveness. 
• A cartoon in The New Yorker magazine some time ago showed an 
office on the door of which was the legend: Chas. Smith, 
General Sales Manager, Ajax Soap Company. The walls were 
bare except for a big sign saying Think. The man in the 
office had his feet propped up on his desk and was blowing 
smoke rings at the ceiling. Outside two older men went by, 
the one saying to the other: “But how can we be sure that 
Smith thinks soap?” 
One can indeed never be sure what the knowledge worker 
thinks—and yet thinking is his specific work; it is his “doing.” 
The motivation of the knowledge worker depends on his 
* If effectiveness is 
lacking in his work, his commitment to work and to contribution 
will soon wither, and he will become a time-server going 
through the motions from 9 to 5. 
The knowledge worker does not produce something that is 
effective by itself. He does not produce a physical product —a 
ditch, a pair of shoes, a machine part. He produces knowledge, 
ideas, information. By themselves these “products” are useless. 
Somebody else, another man of knowledge, has to take them as 
his input and convert them into his output before they have any 
reality. The greatest wisdom not applied to action and behavior

is meaningless data. The knowledge worker, therefore, must do 
something which a manual worker need not do. He must provide 
effectiveness. He cannot depend on the utility his output 
carries with it as does a well-made pair of shoes. 
The knowledge worker is the one “factor of production” 
through which the highly developed societies and economies of 
today—the United States, Western Europe, Japan, and also 
increasingly, the Soviet Union—become and remain competitive. 
• This is particularly true of the United States. The only resource in 
respect to which America can possibly have a competitive 
advantage is education. American education may leave a 
good deal to be desired, but it is massive beyond anything 
poorer societies can afford. For education is the most expensive 
capital investment we have ever known. A Ph.D. in the 
natural sciences represents $100,000 to $200,000 of social 
capital investment. Even the boy who graduates from college 
without any specific professional competence represents an 
investment of $50,000 or more. This only a very rich society 
can afford. 
Education is the one area, therefore, in which the richest 
of all societies, the United States, has a genuine advantage— 
provided it can make the knowledge worker productive. And 
productivity for the knowledge worker means the ability to 
get the right things done. It means effectiveness. 
WHO IS AN EXECUTIVE? 
Every knowledge worker in modern organization is an “executive” 
if, by virtue of his position or knowledge, he is responsible 
for a contribution that materially affects the capacity of the 
organization to perform and to obtain results, This may be the 
capacity of a business to bring out a new product or to obtain a 
E F F ECTI V ENE S S CAN B E L E A RNED 5?
6
larger share of a given market. It may be the capacity of a hospital 
to provide bedside care to its patients, and so on. Such a man 
(or woman) must make decisions; he cannot just carry out 
orders. He must take responsibility for his contribution. And he 
is supposed, by virtue of his knowledge, to be better equipped to 
make the right decision than anyone else. He may be overridden; 
he may be demoted or fired. But so long as he has the job the 
goals, the standards, and the contribution are in his keeping. 
Most managers are executives—though not all. But many 
nonmanagers are also becoming executives in modern society. 
For the knowledge organization, as we have been learning these 
last few years, needs both “managers” and “individual professional 
contributors” in positions of responsibility, decision-making, 
and authority. 
This fact is perhaps best illustrated by a recent newspaper 
interview with a young American infantry captain in the 
Vietnam jungle. 
• Asked by the reporter, “How in this confused situation can 
you retain command?” the young captain said: “Around 
here, I am only the guy who is responsible. If these men don’t 
know what to do when they run into an enemy in the jungle, 
I’m too far away to tell them. My job is to make sure they 
know. What they do depends on the situation which only 
they can judge. The responsibility is always mine, but the 
decision lies with whoever is on the spot.” 
In a guerrilla war, every man is an “executive.” 
There are many managers who are not executives. Many people, 
in other words, are superiors of other people—and often of 
fairly large numbers of other people—and still do not seriously 
affect the ability of the organization to perform. Most foremen 
in a manufacturing plant belong here. They are “overseers” in the 
literal sense of the word.

WHY WE NEED EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVES 
All this should be obvious. But why then has so little attention 
been paid to effectiveness, in an age in which there are 
mountains of books and articles on every other aspect of the 
executive’s tasks? 
One reason for this neglect is that effectiveness is the specific 
technology of the knowledge worker within an organization. 
Until recently, there was no more than a handful of these 
around. 
For manual work, we need only efficiency; that is, the ability 
to do things right rather than the ability to get the right things 
done. The manual worker can always be judged in terms of the 
quantity and quality of a definable and discrete output, such as a 
pair of shoes. We have learned how to measure efficiency and 
how to define quality in manual work during the last hundred 
years—to the point where we have been able to multiply the output 
of the individual worker tremendously. 
Formerly, the manual worker—whether machine operator or 
front-line soldier—predominated in all organizations. Few people 
of effectiveness were needed: those at the top who gave the 
orders that others carded out. They were so small a fraction of 
the total work population that we could, rightly or wrongly, take 
their effectiveness for granted. We could depend on the supply of 
“naturals,” the few people in any area of human endeavor who 
somehow know what the rest of us have to learn the hard way. 
• This was true not only of business and the army. It is hard to 
realize today that “government” during the American Civil 
War a hundred years ago meant the merest handful of people. 
Lincoln’s Secretary of War had fewer than fifty civilian 
subordinates, most of them not “executives” and policy-makers 
but telegraph clerks. The entire Washington establishment 
of the U.S. government in Theodore Roosevelt’s time, 
THE EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVE?
around 1900, could be comfortably housed in any one of the 
government buildings along the Mall today. 
The hospital of yesterday did not know any of the 
“health-service professionals,” the X-ray and lab technicians, 
the dieticians and therapists, the social workers, and so on, of 
whom it now employs as many as two hundred and fifty for 
every one hundred patients. Apart from a few nurses, there 
were only cleaning women, cooks, and maids. The physician 
was the knowledge worker, with the nurse as his aide. 
In other words, up to recent times, the major problem of 
organization was efficiency in the performance of the manual 
worker who did what he had been told to do. Knowledge 
workers were not predominant in organization. 
In fact, only a small fraction of the knowledge workers of 
earlier days were part of an organization. Most of them worked 
by themselves as professionals, at best with a clerk. Their effectiveness 
or lack of effectiveness concerned only themselves and 
affected only themselves. 
Today, however, the large knowledge organization is the central 
reality. Modern society is a society of large organized institutions. 
In every one of them, including the armed services, the 
center of gravity has shifted to the knowledge worker, the man 
who puts to work what he has between his ears rather than the 
brawn of his muscles or the skill of his hands. Increasingly, the 
majority of people who have been schooled to use knowledge, 
theory, and concept rather than physical force or manual skill 
work in an organization and are effective insofar as they can 
make a contribution to the organization. 
Now effectiveness can no longer be taken for granted. Now it 
can no longer be neglected. 
The imposing system of measurements and tests which we 
have developed for manual work—from industrial engineering 
E F F ECTI V ENE S S CAN B E L E A RNED 3?
4
to quality control—is not applicable to knowledge work. There 
are few things less pleasing to the Lord, and less productive, than 
an engineering department that rapidly turns out beautiful blueprints 
for the wrong product. Working on the right things is 
what makes knowledge work effective. This is not capable of 
being measured by any of the yardsticks for manual work. 
The knowledge worker cannot be supervised closely or in 
detail. He can only be helped. But he must direct himself, and he 
must direct himself toward performance and contribution, that 
is, toward effectiveness. 
• A cartoon in The New Yorker magazine some time ago showed an 
office on the door of which was the legend: Chas. Smith, 
General Sales Manager, Ajax Soap Company. The walls were 
bare except for a big sign saying Think. The man in the 
office had his feet propped up on his desk and was blowing 
smoke rings at the ceiling. Outside two older men went by, 
the one saying to the other: “But how can we be sure that 
Smith thinks soap?” 
One can indeed never be sure what the knowledge worker 
thinks—and yet thinking is his specific work; it is his “doing.” 
The motivation of the knowledge worker depends on his

lacking in his work, his commitment to work and to contribution 
will soon wither, and he will become a time-server going 
through the motions from 9 to 5. 
The knowledge worker does not produce something that is 
effective by itself. He does not produce a physical product —a 
ditch, a pair of shoes, a machine part. He produces knowledge, 
ideas, information. By themselves these “products” are useless. 
Somebody else, another man of knowledge, has to take them as 
his input and convert them into his output before they have any

is meaningless data. The knowledge worker, therefore, must do 
something which a manual worker need not do. He must provide 
effectiveness. He cannot depend on the utility his output 
carries with it as does a well-made pair of shoes. 
The knowledge worker is the one “factor of production” 
through which the highly developed societies and economies of 
today—the United States, Western Europe, Japan, and also 
increasingly, the Soviet Union—become and remain competitive. 
• This is particularly true of the United States. The only resource in 
respect to which America can possibly have a competitive 
advantage is education. American education may leave a 
good deal to be desired, but it is massive beyond anything 
poorer societies can afford. For education is the most expensive 
capital investment we have ever known. A Ph.D. in the 
natural sciences represents $100,000 to $200,000 of social 
capital investment. Even the boy who graduates from college 
without any specific professional competence represents an 
investment of $50,000 or more. This only a very rich society 
can afford. 
Education is the one area, therefore, in which the richest 
of all societies, the United States, has a genuine advantage— 
provided it can make the knowledge worker productive. And 
productivity for the knowledge worker means the ability to 
get the right things done. It means effectiveness. 
WHO IS AN EXECUTIVE? 
Every knowledge worker in modern organization is an “executive” 
if, by virtue of his position or knowledge, he is responsible 
for a contribution that materially affects the capacity of the 
organization to perform and to obtain results, This may be the 
capacity of a business to bring out a new product or to obtain a 
E F F ECTI V ENE S S CAN B E L E A RNED 5?
6
larger share of a given market. It may be the capacity of a hospital 
to provide bedside care to its patients, and so on. Such a man 
(or woman) must make decisions; he cannot just carry out 
orders. He must take responsibility for his contribution. And he 
is supposed, by virtue of his knowledge, to be better equipped to 
make the right decision than anyone else. He may be overridden; 
he may be demoted or fired. But so long as he has the job the 
goals, the standards, and the contribution are in his keeping. 
Most managers are executives—though not all. But many 
nonmanagers are also becoming executives in modern society. 
For the knowledge organization, as we have been learning these 
last few years, needs both “managers” and “individual professional 
contributors” in positions of responsibility, decision-making, 
and authority. 
This fact is perhaps best illustrated by a recent newspaper 
interview with a young American infantry captain in the 
Vietnam jungle. 
• Asked by the reporter, “How in this confused situation can 
you retain command?” the young captain said: “Around 
here, I am only the guy who is responsible. If these men don’t 
know what to do when they run into an enemy in the jungle, 
I’m too far away to tell them. My job is to make sure they 
know. What they do depends on the situation which only 
they can judge. The responsibility is always mine, but the 
decision lies with whoever is on the spot.” 
In a guerrilla war, every man is an “executive.” 
There are many managers who are not executives. Many people, 
in other words, are superiors of other people—and often of 
fairly large numbers of other people—and still do not seriously 
affect the ability of the organization to perform. Most foremen 
in a manufacturing plant belong here. They are “overseers” in the 
literal sense of the word. 

Preface 
Management books usually deal with managing other people. The 
subject of this book is managing oneself for effectiveness. That one can 
truly manage other people is by no means adequately proven. But one 
can always manage oneself. Indeed, executives who do not manage 
themselves for effectiveness cannot possibly expect to manage their 
associates and subordinates. Management is largely by example. 
Executives who do not know how to make themselves effective in their 
own job and work set the wrong example. 
To be reasonably effective it is not enough for the individual to be 
intelligent, to work hard or to be knowledgeable. Effectiveness is something 
separate, something different. But to be effective also does not 
require special gifts, special aptitude, or special training. Effectiveness 
as an executive demands doing certain—and fairly simple—things. It 
consists of a small number of practices, the practices that are presented 
and discussed in this book. But these practices are not “inborn.” In 
forty-five years of work as a consultant with a large number of executives 
in a wide variety of organizations—large and small; businesses, 
government agencies, labor unions, hospitals, universities, community 
services; American, European, Latin American and Japanese—I have 
not come across a single “natural”: an executive who was born effective. 
All the effective ones have had to learn to be effective. And all of 
them then had to practice effectiveness until it became habit. But all 
the ones who worked on making themselves effective executives succeeded 
in doing so. Effectiveness can be learned—and it also has to be 
learned. 
Effectiveness is what executives are being paid for, whether they 
work as managers who are responsible for the performance of others as?
viii 
well as their own, or as individual professional contributors responsible 
for their own performance only. Without effectiveness there is no “performance,” 
no matter how much intelligence and knowledge goes into 
the work, no matter how many hours it takes. Yet it is perhaps not too 
surprising that we have so far paid little attention to the effective executive. 
Organizations—whether business enterprises, large government 
agencies, labor unions, large hospitals or large universities—are, after 
all, brand new. A century ago almost no one had even much contact 
with such organizations beyond an occasional trip to the local post 
office to mail a letter. And effectiveness as an executive means effectiveness 
in and through an organization. Until recently there was little 
reason for anyone to pay much attention to the effective executive or 
to worry about the low effectiveness of so many of them. Now, however, 
most people—especially those with even a fair amount of schooling—
can expect to spend all their working lives in an organization of 
some kind. Society has become a society of organizations in all developed 
countries. Now the effectiveness of the individual depends 
increasingly on his or her ability to be effective in an organization, to 
be effective as an executive. And the effectiveness of a modern society 
and its ability to perform—perhaps even its ability to survive—depend 
increasingly on the effectiveness of the people who work as executives 
in the organizations. The effective executive is fast becoming a key 
resource for society, and effectiveness as an executive a prime requirement 
for individual accomplishment and achievement—for young 
people at the beginning of their working lives fully as much as for people 
in mid-career.

1: Effectiveness Can Be 
Learned 
To be effective is the job of the executive. “To effect” and “to execute” 
are, after all, near-synonyms. Whether he works in a business 
or in a hospital, in a government agency or in a labor union, 
in a university or in the army, the executive is, first of all, 
expected to get the right things done. And this is simply that he is 
expected to be effective. 
Yet men of high effectiveness are conspicuous by their 
absence in executive jobs. High intelligence is common enough 
among executives. Imagination is far from rare. The level of 
knowledge tends to be high. But there seems to be little correlation 
between a man’s effectiveness and his intelligence, his imagination 
or his knowledge. Brilliant men are often strikingly ineffectual; 
they fail to realize that the brilliant insight is not by itself

something which a manual worker need not do. He must provide 
effectiveness. He cannot depend on the utility his output 
carries with it as does a well-made pair of shoes. 
The knowledge worker is the one “factor of production” 
through which the highly developed societies and economies of 
today—the United States, Western Europe, Japan, and also 
increasingly, the Soviet Union—become and remain competitive. 
• This is particularly true of the United States. The only resource in 
respect to which America can possibly have a competitive 
advantage is education. American education may leave a 
good deal to be desired, but it is massive beyond anything 
poorer societies can afford. For education is the most expensive 
capital investment we have ever known. A Ph.D. in the 
natural sciences represents $100,000 to $200,000 of social 
capital investment. Even the boy who graduates from college 
without any specific professional competence represents an 
investment of $50,000 or more. This only a very rich society 
can afford. 
Education is the one area, therefore, in which the richest 
of all societies, the United States, has a genuine advantage— 
provided it can make the knowledge worker productive. And 
productivity for the knowledge worker means the ability to 
get the right things done. It means effectiveness. 
WHO IS AN EXECUTIVE? 
Every knowledge worker in modern organization is an “executive” 
if, by virtue of his position or knowledge, he is responsible 
for a contribution that materially affects the capacity of the 
organization to perform and to obtain results, This may be the 
capacity of a business to bring out a new product or to obtain a 
E F F ECTI V ENE S S CAN B E L E A RNED 5?
6
larger share of a given market. It may be the capacity of a hospital 
to provide bedside care to its patients, and so on. Such a man 
(or woman) must make decisions; he cannot just carry out 
orders. He must take responsibility for his contribution. And he 
is supposed, by virtue of his knowledge, to be better equipped to 
make the right decision than anyone else. He may be overridden; 
he may be demoted or fired. But so long as he has the job the 
goals, the standards, and the contribution are in his keeping. 
Most managers are executives—though not all. But many 
nonmanagers are also becoming executives in modern society. 
For the knowledge organization, as we have been learning these 
last few years, needs both “managers” and “individual professional 
contributors” in positions of responsibility, decision-making, 
and authority. 
This fact is perhaps best illustrated by a recent newspaper 
interview with a young American infantry captain in the 
Vietnam jungle. 
• Asked by the reporter, “How in this confused situation can 
you retain command?” the young captain said: “Around 
here, I am only the guy who is responsible. If these men don’t 
know what to do when they run into an enemy in the jungle, 
I’m too far away to tell them. My job is to make sure they 
know. What they do depends on the situation which only 
they can judge. The responsibility is always mine, but the 
decision lies with whoever is on the spot.” 
In a guerrilla war, every man is an “executive.” 
There are many managers who are not executives. Many people, 
in other words, are superiors of other people—and often of 
fairly large numbers of other people—and still do not seriously 
affect the ability of the organization to perform. Most foremen 
in a manufacturing plant belong here. They are “overseers” in the 
literal sense of the word. 

Preface 
Management books usually deal with managing other people. The 
subject of this book is managing oneself for effectiveness. That one can 
truly manage other people is by no means adequately proven. But one 
can always manage oneself. Indeed, executives who do not manage 
themselves for effectiveness cannot possibly expect to manage their 
associates and subordinates. Management is largely by example. 
Executives who do not know how to make themselves effective in their 
own job and work set the wrong example. 
To be reasonably effective it is not enough for the individual to be 
intelligent, to work hard or to be knowledgeable. Effectiveness is something 
separate, something different. But to be effective also does not 
require special gifts, special aptitude, or special training. Effectiveness 
as an executive demands doing certain—and fairly simple—things. It 
consists of a small number of practices, the practices that are presented 
and discussed in this book. But these practices are not “inborn.” In 
forty-five years of work as a consultant with a large number of executives 
in a wide variety of organizations—large and small; businesses, 
government agencies, labor unions, hospitals, universities, community 
services; American, European, Latin American and Japanese—I have 
not come across a single “natural”: an executive who was born effective. 
All the effective ones have had to learn to be effective. And all of 
them then had to practice effectiveness until it became habit. But all 
the ones who worked on making themselves effective executives succeeded 
in doing so. Effectiveness can be learned—and it also has to be 
learned. 
Effectiveness is what executives are being paid for, whether they 
work as managers who are responsible for the performance of others as?
viii 
well as their own, or as individual professional contributors responsible 
for their own performance only. Without effectiveness there is no “performance,” 
no matter how much intelligence and knowledge goes into 
the work, no matter how many hours it takes. Yet it is perhaps not too 
surprising that we have so far paid little attention to the effective executive. 
Organizations—whether business enterprises, large government 
agencies, labor unions, large hospitals or large universities—are, after 
all, brand new. A century ago almost no one had even much contact 
with such organizations beyond an occasional trip to the local post 
office to mail a letter. And effectiveness as an executive means effectiveness 
in and through an organization. Until recently there was little 
reason for anyone to pay much attention to the effective executive or 
to worry about the low effectiveness of so many of them. Now, however, 
most people—especially those with even a fair amount of schooling—
can expect to spend all their working lives in an organization of 
some kind. Society has become a society of organizations in all developed 
countries. Now the effectiveness of the individual depends 
increasingly on his or her ability to be effective in an organization, to 
be effective as an executive. And the effectiveness of a modern society 
and its ability to perform—perhaps even its ability to survive—depend 
increasingly on the effectiveness of the people who work as executives 
in the organizations. The effective executive is fast becoming a key 
resource for society, and effectiveness as an executive a prime requirement 
for individual accomplishment and achievement—for young 
people at the beginning of their working lives fully as much as for people 
in mid-career.

1: Effectiveness Can Be 
Learned 
To be effective is the job of the executive. “To effect” and “to execute” 
are, after all, near-synonyms. Whether he works in a business 
or in a hospital, in a government agency or in a labor union, 
in a university or in the army, the executive is, first of all, 
expected to get the right things done. And this is simply that he is 
expected to be effective. 
Yet men of high effectiveness are conspicuous by their 
absence in executive jobs. High intelligence is common enough 
among executives. Imagination is far from rare. The level of 
knowledge tends to be high. But there seems to be little correlation 
between a man’s effectiveness and his intelligence, his imagination 
or his knowledge. Brilliant men are often strikingly ineffectual; 
they fail to realize that the brilliant insight is not by itself 
achievement. They never have learned that insights become 
effectiveness only through hard systematic work. Conversely, in 
every organization there are some highly effective plodders. 
While others rush around in the frenzy and busyness which very 
bright people so often confuse with “creativity,” the plodder puts 
one foot in front of the other and gets there first, like the tortoise 
in the old fable. 
Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential 
resources, but only effectiveness converts them into results. By 
themselves, they only set limits to what can be attained.

WHY WE NEED EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVES 
All this should be obvious. But why then has so little attention 
been paid to effectiveness, in an age in which there are 
mountains of books and articles on every other aspect of the 
executive’s tasks? 
One reason for this neglect is that effectiveness is the specific 
technology of the knowledge worker within an organization. 
Until recently, there was no more than a handful of these 
around. 
For manual work, we need only efficiency; that is, the ability 
to do things right rather than the ability to get the right things 
done. The manual worker can always be judged in terms of the 
quantity and quality of a definable and discrete output, such as a 
pair of shoes. We have learned how to measure efficiency and 
how to define quality in manual work during the last hundred 
years—to the point where we have been able to multiply the output 
of the individual worker tremendously. 
Formerly, the manual worker—whether machine operator or 
front-line soldier—predominated in all organizations. Few people 
of effectiveness were needed: those at the top who gave the 
orders that others carded out. They were so small a fraction of 
the total work population that we could, rightly or wrongly, take 
their effectiveness for granted. We could depend on the supply of 
“naturals,” the few people in any area of human endeavor who 
somehow know what the rest of us have to learn the hard way. 
• This was true not only of business and the army. It is hard to 
realize today that “government” during the American Civil 
War a hundred years ago meant the merest handful of people. 
Lincoln’s Secretary of War had fewer than fifty civilian 
subordinates, most of them not “executives” and policy-makers 
but telegraph clerks. The entire Washington establishment 
of the U.S. government in Theodore Roosevelt’s time, 
THE EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVE?
around 1900, could be comfortably housed in any one of the 
government buildings along the Mall today. 
The hospital of yesterday did not know any of the 
“health-service professionals,” the X-ray and lab technicians, 
the dieticians and therapists, the social workers, and so on, of 
whom it now employs as many as two hundred and fifty for 
every one hundred patients. Apart from a few nurses, there 
were only cleaning women, cooks, and maids. The physician 
was the knowledge worker, with the nurse as his aide. 
In other words, up to recent times, the major problem of 
organization was efficiency in the performance of the manual 
worker who did what he had been told to do. Knowledge 
workers were not predominant in organization. 
In fact, only a small fraction of the knowledge workers of 
earlier days were part of an organization. Most of them worked 
by themselves as professionals, at best with a clerk. Their effectiveness 
or lack of effectiveness concerned only themselves and 
affected only themselves. 
Today, however, the large knowledge organization is the central 
reality. Modern society is a society of large organized institutions. 
In every one of them, including the armed services, the 
center of gravity has shifted to the knowledge worker, the man 
who puts to work what he has between his ears rather than the 
brawn of his muscles or the skill of his hands. Increasingly, the 
majority of people who have been schooled to use knowledge, 
theory, and concept rather than physical force or manual skill 
work in an organization and are effective insofar as they can 
make a contribution to the organization.

larger share of a given market. It may be the capacity of a hospital 
to provide bedside care to its patients, and so on. Such a man 
(or woman) must make decisions; he cannot just carry out 
orders. He must take responsibility for his contribution. And he 
is supposed, by virtue of his knowledge, to be better equipped to 
make the right decision than anyone else. He may be overridden; 
he may be demoted or fired. But so long as he has the job the 
goals, the standards, and the contribution are in his keeping. 
Most managers are executives—though not all. But many 
nonmanagers are also becoming executives in modern society. 
For the knowledge organization, as we have been learning these 
last few years, needs both “managers” and “individual professional 
contributors” in positions of responsibility, decision-making, 
and authority. 
This fact is perhaps best illustrated by a recent newspaper 
interview with a young American infantry captain in the 
Vietnam jungle. 
• Asked by the reporter, “How in this confused situation can 
you retain command?” the young captain said: “Around 
here, I am only the guy who is responsible. If these men don’t 
know what to do when they run into an enemy in the jungle, 
I’m too far away to tell them. My job is to make sure they 
know. What they do depends on the situation which only 
they can judge. The responsibility is always mine, but the 
decision lies with whoever is on the spot.” 
In a guerrilla war, every man is an “executive.” 
There are many managers who are not executives. Many people, 
in other words, are superiors of other people—and often of 
fairly large numbers of other people—and still do not seriously 
affect the ability of the organization to perform. Most foremen 
in a manufacturing plant belong here. They are “overseers” in the 
literal sense of the word. 

Preface 
Management books usually deal with managing other people. The 
subject of this book is managing oneself for effectiveness. That one can 
truly manage other people is by no means adequately proven. But one 
can always manage oneself. Indeed, executives who do not manage 
themselves for effectiveness cannot possibly expect to manage their 
associates and subordinates. Management is largely by example. 
Executives who do not know how to make themselves effective in their 
own job and work set the wrong example. 
To be reasonably effective it is not enough for the individual to be 
intelligent, to work hard or to be knowledgeable. Effectiveness is something 
separate, something different. But to be effective also does not 
require special gifts, special aptitude, or special training. Effectiveness 
as an executive demands doing certain—and fairly simple—things. It 
consists of a small number of practices, the practices that are presented 
and discussed in this book. But these practices are not “inborn.” In 
forty-five years of work as a consultant with a large number of executives 
in a wide variety of organizations—large and small; businesses, 
government agencies, labor unions, hospitals, universities, community 
services; American, European, Latin American and Japanese—I have 
not come across a single “natural”: an executive who was born effective. 
All the effective ones have had to learn to be effective. And all of 
them then had to practice effectiveness until it became habit. But all 
the ones who worked on making themselves effective executives succeeded 
in doing so. Effectiveness can be learned—and it also has to be 
learned. 
Effectiveness is what executives are being paid for, whether they 
work as managers who are responsible for the performance of others as?
viii 
well as their own, or as individual professional contributors responsible 
for their own performance only. Without effectiveness there is no “performance,” 
no matter how much intelligence and knowledge goes into 
the work, no matter how many hours it takes. Yet it is perhaps not too 
surprising that we have so far paid little attention to the effective executive. 
Organizations—whether business enterprises, large government 
agencies, labor unions, large hospitals or large universities—are, after 
all, brand new. A century ago almost no one had even much contact 
with such organizations beyond an occasional trip to the local post 
office to mail a letter. And effectiveness as an executive means effectiveness 
in and through an organization. Until recently there was little 
reason for anyone to pay much attention to the effective executive or 
to worry about the low effectiveness of so many of them. Now, however, 
most people—especially those with even a fair amount of schooling—
can expect to spend all their working lives in an organization of 
some kind. Society has become a society of organizations in all developed 
countries. Now the effectiveness of the individual depends 
increasingly on his or her ability to be effective in an organization, to 
be effective as an executive. And the effectiveness of a modern society 
and its ability to perform—perhaps even its ability to survive—depend 
increasingly on the effectiveness of the people who work as executives 
in the organizations. The effective executive is fast becoming a key 
resource for society, and effectiveness as an executive a prime requirement 
for individual accomplishment and achievement—for young 
people at the beginning of their working lives fully as much as for people 
in mid-career.

1: Effectiveness Can Be 
Learned 
To be effective is the job of the executive. “To effect” and “to execute” 
are, after all, near-synonyms. Whether he works in a business 
or in a hospital, in a government agency or in a labor union, 
in a university or in the army, the executive is, first of all, 
expected to get the right things done. And this is simply that he is 
expected to be effective. 
Yet men of high effectiveness are conspicuous by their 
absence in executive jobs. High intelligence is common enough 
among executives. Imagination is far from rare. The level of 
knowledge tends to be high. But there seems to be little correlation 
between a man’s effectiveness and his intelligence, his imagination 
or his knowledge. Brilliant men are often strikingly ineffectual; 
they fail to realize that the brilliant insight is not by itself 
achievement. They never have learned that insights become 
effectiveness only through hard systematic work. Conversely, in 
every organization there are some highly effective plodders. 
While others rush around in the frenzy and busyness which very 
bright people so often confuse with “creativity,” the plodder puts 
one foot in front of the other and gets there first, like the tortoise 
in the old fable. 
Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential 
resources, but only effectiveness converts them into results. By 
themselves, they only set limits to what can be attained.

WHY WE NEED EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVES 
All this should be obvious. But why then has so little attention 
been paid to effectiveness, in an age in which there are 
mountains of books and articles on every other aspect of the 
executive’s tasks? 
One reason for this neglect is that effectiveness is the specific 
technology of the knowledge worker within an organization. 
Until recently, there was no more than a handful of these 
around. 
For manual work, we need only efficiency; that is, the ability 
to do things right rather than the ability to get the right things 
done. The manual worker can always be judged in terms of the 
quantity and quality of a definable and discrete output, such as a 
pair of shoes. We have learned how to measure efficiency and 
how to define quality in manual work during the last hundred 
years—to the point where we have been able to multiply the output 
of the individual worker tremendously. 
Formerly, the manual worker—whether machine operator or 
front-line soldier—predominated in all organizations. Few people 
of effectiveness were needed: those at the top who gave the 
orders that others carded out. They were so small a fraction of 
the total work population that we could, rightly or wrongly, take 
their effectiveness for granted. We could depend on the supply of 
“naturals,” the few people in any area of human endeavor who 
somehow know what the rest of us have to learn the hard way. 
• This was true not only of business and the army. It is hard to 
realize today that “government” during the American Civil 
War a hundred years ago meant the merest handful of people. 
Lincoln’s Secretary of War had fewer than fifty civilian 
subordinates, most of them not “executives” and policy-makers 
but telegraph clerks. The entire Washington establishment 
of the U.S. government in Theodore Roosevelt’s time, 
THE EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVE?
around 1900, could be comfortably housed in any one of the 
government buildings along the Mall today. 
The hospital of yesterday did not know any of the 
“health-service professionals,” the X-ray and lab technicians, 
the dieticians and therapists, the social workers, and so on, of 
whom it now employs as many as two hundred and fifty for 
every one hundred patients. Apart from a few nurses, there 
were only cleaning women, cooks, and maids. The physician 
was the knowledge worker, with the nurse as his aide. 
In other words, up to recent times, the major problem of 
organization was efficiency in the performance of the manual 
worker who did what he had been told to do. Knowledge 
workers were not predominant in organization. 
In fact, only a small fraction of the knowledge workers of 
earlier days were part of an organization. Most of them worked 
by themselves as professionals, at best with a clerk. Their effectiveness 
or lack of effectiveness concerned only themselves and 
affected only themselves. 
Today, however, the large knowledge organization is the central 
reality. Modern society is a society of large organized institutions. 
In every one of them, including the armed services, the 
center of gravity has shifted to the knowledge worker, the man 
who puts to work what he has between his ears rather than the 
brawn of his muscles or the skill of his hands. Increasingly, the 
majority of people who have been schooled to use knowledge, 
theory, and concept rather than physical force or manual skill 
work in an organization and are effective insofar as they can 
make a contribution to the organization. 
Now effectiveness can no longer be taken for granted. Now it 
can no longer be neglected. 
The imposing system of measurements and tests which we 
have developed for manual work—from industrial engineering 
E F F ECTI V ENE S S CAN B E L E A RNED 3?
4
to quality control—is not applicable to knowledge work. There 
are few things less pleasing to the Lord, and less productive, than 
an engineering department that rapidly turns out beautiful blueprints 
for the wrong product. Working on the right things is 
what makes knowledge work effective. This is not capable of 
being measured by any of the yardsticks for manual work. 
The knowledge worker cannot be supervised closely or in 
detail. He can only be helped. But he must direct himself, and he 
must direct himself toward performance and contribution, that 
is, toward effectiveness. 
• A cartoon in The New Yorker magazine some time ago showed an 
office on the door of which was the legend: Chas. Smith, 
General Sales Manager, Ajax Soap Company. The walls were 
bare except for a big sign saying Think. The man in the 
office had his feet propped up on his desk and was blowing 
smoke rings at the ceiling. Outside two older men went by, 
the one saying to the other: “But how can we be sure that 
Smith thinks soap?” 
One can indeed never be sure what the knowledge worker 
thinks—and yet thinking is his specific work; it is his “doing.” 
The motivation of the knowledge worker depends on his 
* If effectiveness is 
lacking in his work, his commitment to work and to contribution 
will soon wither, and he will become a time-server going 
through the motions from 9 to 5. 
The knowledge worker does not produce something that is 
effective by itself. He does not produce a physical product —a 
ditch, a pair of shoes, a machine part. He produces knowledge, 
ideas, information. By themselves these “products” are useless. 
Somebody else, another man of knowledge, has to take them as 
his input and convert them into his output before they have any 
reality. The greatest wisdom not applied to action and behavior

is meaningless data. The knowledge worker, therefore, must do 
something which a manual worker need not do. He must provide 
effectiveness. He cannot depend on the utility his output 
carries with it as does a well-made pair of shoes. 
The knowledge worker is the one “factor of production” 
through which the highly developed societies and economies of 
today—the United States, Western Europe, Japan, and also 
increasingly, the Soviet Union—become and remain competitive. 
• This is particularly true of the United States. The only resource in 
respect to which America can possibly have a competitive 
advantage is education. American education may leave a 
good deal to be desired, but it is massive beyond anything 
poorer societies can afford. For education is the most expensive 
capital investment we have ever known. A Ph.D. in the 
natural sciences represents $100,000 to $200,000 of social 
capital investment. Even the boy who graduates from college 
without any specific professional competence represents an 
investment of $50,000 or more. This only a very rich society 
can afford. 
Education is the one area, therefore, in which the richest 
of all societies, the United States, has a genuine advantage— 
provided it can make the knowledge worker productive. And 
productivity for the knowledge worker means the ability to 
get the right things done. It means effectiveness. 
WHO IS AN EXECUTIVE? 
Every knowledge worker in modern organization is an “executive” 
if, by virtue of his position or knowledge, he is responsible 
for a contribution that materially affects the capacity of the 
organization to perform and to obtain results, This may be the 
capacity of a business to bring out a new product or to obtain a

larger share of a given market. It may be the capacity of a hospital 
to provide bedside care to its patients, and so on. Such a man 
(or woman) must make decisions; he cannot just carry out 
orders. He must take responsibility for his contribution. And he 
is supposed, by virtue of his knowledge, to be better equipped to 
make the right decision than anyone else. He may be overridden; 
he may be demoted or fired. But so long as he has the job the

increasingly on the effectiveness of the people who work as executives

1: Effectiveness Can Be 
Learned 
To be effective is the job of the executive. “To effect” and “to execute” 
are, after all, near-synonyms. Whether he works in a business 
or in a hospital, in a government agency or in a labor union, 
in a university or in the army, the executive is, first of all, 
expected to get the right things done. And this is simply that he is 
expected to be effective. 
Yet men of high effectiveness are conspicuous by their 
absence in executive jobs. High intelligence is common enough 
among executives. Imagination is far from rare. The level of 
knowledge tends to be high. But there seems to be little correlation 
between a man’s effectiveness and his intelligence, his imagination 
or his knowledge. Brilliant men are often strikingly ineffectual; 
they fail to realize that the brilliant insight is not by itself 
achievement. They never have learned that insights become 
effectiveness only through hard systematic work. Conversely, in 
every organization there are some highly effective plodders. 
While others rush around in the frenzy and busyness which very 
bright people so often confuse with “creativity,” the plodder puts 
one foot in front of the other and gets there first, like the tortoise 
in the old fable. 
Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential 
resources, but only effectiveness converts them into results. By 
themselves, they only set limits to what can be attained.

WHY WE NEED EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVES 
All this should be obvious. But why then has so little attention 
been paid to effectiveness, in an age in which there are 
mountains of books and articles on every other aspect of the 
executive’s tasks? 
One reason for this neglect is that effectiveness is the specific 
technology of the knowledge worker within an organization. 
Until recently, there was no more than a handful of these 
around. 
For manual work, we need only efficiency; that is, the ability 
to do things right rather than the ability to get the right things 
done. The manual worker can always be judged in terms of the 
quantity and quality of a definable and discrete output, such as a 
pair of shoes. We have learned how to measure efficiency and 
how to define quality in manual work during the last hundred 
years—to the point where we have been able to multiply the output 
of the individual worker tremendously. 
Formerly, the manual worker—whether machine operator or 
front-line soldier—predominated in all organizations. Few people 
of effectiveness were needed: those at the top who gave the 
orders that others carded out. They were so small a fraction of 
the total work population that we could, rightly or wrongly, take 
their effectiveness for granted. We could depend on the supply of 
“naturals,” the few people in any area of human endeavor who 
somehow know what the rest of us have to learn the hard way. 
• This was true not only of business and the army. It is hard to 
realize today that “government” during the American Civil 
War a hundred years ago meant the merest handful of people. 
Lincoln’s Secretary of War had fewer than fifty civilian 
subordinates, most of them not “executives” and policy-makers 
but telegraph clerks. The entire Washington establishment 
of the U.S. government in Theodore Roosevelt’s time, 
THE EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVE?
around 1900, could be comfortably housed in any one of the 
government buildings along the Mall today. 
The hospital of yesterday did not know any of the 
“health-service professionals,” the X-ray and lab technicians, 
the dieticians and therapists, the social workers, and so on, of 
whom it now employs as many as two hundred and fifty for 
every one hundred patients. Apart from a few nurses, there 
were only cleaning women, cooks, and maids. The physician 
was the knowledge worker, with the nurse as his aide. 
In other words, up to recent times, the major problem of 
organization was efficiency in the performance of the manual 
worker who did what he had been told to do. Knowledge 
workers were not predominant in organization. 
In fact, only a small fraction of the knowledge workers of 
earlier days were part of an organization. Most of them worked 
by themselves as professionals, at best with a clerk. Their effectiveness 
or lack of effectiveness concerned only themselves and 
affected only themselves. 
Today, however, the large knowledge organization is the central 
reality. Modern society is a society of large organized institutions. 
In every one of them, including the armed services, the 
center of gravity has shifted to the knowledge worker, the man 
who puts to work what he has between his ears rather than the 
brawn of his muscles or the skill of his hands. Increasingly, the 
majority of people who have been schooled to use knowledge, 
theory, and concept rather than physical force or manual skill 
work in an organization and are effective insofar as they can 
make a contribution to the organization. 
Now effectiveness can no longer be taken for granted. Now it 
can no longer be neglected. 
The imposing system of measurements and tests which we 
have developed for manual work—from industrial engineering 
E F F ECTI V ENE S S CAN B E L E A RNED 3?
4
to quality control—is not applicable to knowledge work. There 
are few things less pleasing to the Lord, and less productive, than 
an engineering department that rapidly turns out beautiful blueprints 
for the wrong product. Working on the right things is 
what makes knowledge work effective. This is not capable of 
being measured by any of the yardsticks for manual work. 
The knowledge worker cannot be supervised closely or in 
detail. He can only be helped. But he must direct himself, and he 
must direct himself toward performance and contribution, that 
is, toward effectiveness. 
• A cartoon in The New Yorker magazine some time ago showed an 
office on the door of which was the legend: Chas. Smith, 
General Sales Manager, Ajax Soap Company. The walls were 
bare except for a big sign saying Think. The man in the 
office had his feet propped up on his desk and was blowing 
smoke rings at the ceiling. Outside two older men went by, 
the one saying to the other: “But how can we be sure that 
Smith thinks soap?” 
One can indeed never be sure what the knowledge worker 
thinks—and yet thinking is his specific work; it is his “doing.” 
The motivation of the knowledge worker depends on his

lacking in his work, his commitment to work and to contribution 
will soon wither, and he will become a time-server going 
through the motions from 9 to 5. 
The knowledge worker does not produce something that is 
effective by itself. He does not produce a physical product —a 
ditch, a pair of shoes, a machine part. He produces knowledge, 
ideas, information. By themselves these “products” are useless. 
Somebody else, another man of knowledge, has to take them as 
his input and convert them into his output before they have any 
reality. The greatest wisdom not applied to action and behavior

is meaningless data. The knowledge worker, therefore, must do 
something which a manual worker need not do. He must provide 
effectiveness. He cannot depend on the utility his output 
carries with it as does a well-made pair of shoes. 
The knowledge worker is the one “factor of production” 
through which the highly developed societies and economies of 
today—the United States, Western Europe, Japan, and also 
increasingly, the Soviet Union—become and remain competitive. 
• This is particularly true of the United States. The only resource in 
respect to which America can possibly have a competitive 
advantage is education. American education may leave a 
good deal to be desired, but it is massive beyond anything 
poorer societies can afford. For education is the most expensive 
capital investment we have ever known. A Ph.D. in the 
natural sciences represents $100,000 to $200,000 of social 
capital investment. Even the boy who graduates from college 
without any specific professional competence represents an 
investment of $50,000 or more. This only a very rich society 
can afford. 
Education is the one area, therefore, in which the richest 
of all societies, the United States, has a genuine advantage— 
provided it can make the knowledge worker productive. And 
productivity for the knowledge worker means the ability to 
get the right things done. It means effectiveness. 
WHO IS AN EXECUTIVE? 
Every knowledge worker in modern organization is an “executive” 
if, by virtue of his position or knowledge, he is responsible 
for a contribution that materially affects the capacity of the 
organization to perform and to obtain results, This may be the 
capacity of a business to bring out a new product or to obtain a 
E F F ECTI V ENE S S CAN B E L E A RNED 5?
6
larger share of a given market. It may be the capacity of a hospital 
to provide bedside care to its patients, and so on. Such a man 
(or woman) must make decisions; he cannot just carry out 
orders. He must take responsibility for his contribution. And he 
is supposed, by virtue of his knowledge, to be better equipped to 
make the right decision than anyone else. He may be overridden; 
he may be demoted or fired. But so long as he has the job the 
goals, the standards, and the contribution are in his keeping. 
Most managers are executives—though not all. But many 
nonmanagers are also becoming executives in modern society. 
For the knowledge organization, as we have been learning these 
last few years, needs both “managers” and “individual professional 
contributors” in positions of responsibility, decision-making, 
and authority. 
This fact is perhaps best illustrated by a recent newspaper 
interview with a young American infantry captain in the 
Vietnam jungle. 
• Asked by the reporter, “How in this confused situation can 
you retain command?” the young captain said: “Around 
here, I am only the guy who is responsible. If these men don’t 
know what to do when they run into an enemy in the jungle, 
I’m too far away to tell them. My job is to make sure they 
know. What they do depends on the situation which only 
they can judge. The responsibility is always mine, but the 
decision lies with whoever is on the spot.” 
In a guerrilla war, every man is an “executive.” 
There are many managers who are not executives. Many people, 
in other words, are superiors of other people—and often of 
fairly large numbers of other people—and still do not seriously 
affect the ability of the organization to perform. Most foremen 
in a manufacturing plant belong here. They are “overseers” in the 
literal sense of the word. 

Preface 
Management books usually deal with managing other people. The 
subject of this book is managing oneself for effectiveness. That one can 
truly manage other people is by no means adequately proven. But one 
can always manage oneself. Indeed, executives who do not manage 
themselves for effectiveness cannot possibly expect to manage their 
associates and subordinates. Management is largely by example. 
Executives who do not know how to make themselves effective in their 
own job and work set the wrong example. 
To be reasonably effective it is not enough for the individual to be 
intelligent, to work hard or to be knowledgeable. Effectiveness is something 
separate, something different. But to be effective also does not 
require special gifts, special aptitude, or special training. Effectiveness 
as an executive demands doing certain—and fairly simple—things. It 
consists of a small number of practices, the practices that are presented 
and discussed in this book. But these practices are not “inborn.” In 
forty-five years of work as a consultant with a large number of executives 
in a wide variety of organizations—large and small; businesses, 
government agencies, labor unions, hospitals, universities, community 
services; American, European, Latin American and Japanese—I have 
not come across a single “natural”: an executive who was born effective. 
All the effective ones have had to learn to be effective. And all of 
them then had to practice effectiveness until it became habit. But all 
the ones who worked on making themselves effective executives succeeded 
in doing so. Effectiveness can be learned—and it also has to be 
learned. 
Effectiveness is what executives are being paid for, whether they 
work as managers who are responsible for the performance of others as?
viii 
well as their own, or as individual professional contributors responsible 
for their own performance only. Without effectiveness there is no “performance,” 
no matter how much intelligence and knowledge goes into 
the work, no matter how many hours it takes. Yet it is perhaps not too 
surprising that we have so far paid little attention to the effective executive. 
Organizations—whether business enterprises, large government 
agencies, labor unions, large hospitals or large universities—are, after 
all, brand new. A century ago almost no one had even much contact 
with such organizations beyond an occasional trip to the local post

The hospital of yesterday did not know any of the 
“health-service professionals,” the X-ray and lab technicians, 
the dieticians and therapists, the social workers, and so on, of 
whom it now employs as many as two hundred and fifty for 
every one hundred patients. Apart from a few nurses, there 
were only cleaning women, cooks, and maids. The physician 
was the knowledge worker, with the nurse as his aide. 
In other words, up to recent times, the major problem of 
organization was efficiency in the performance of the manual 
worker who did what he had been told to do. Knowledge 
workers were not predominant in organization. 
In fact, only a small fraction of the knowledge workers of 
earlier days were part of an organization. Most of them worked 
by themselves as professionals, at best with a clerk. Their effectiveness 
or lack of effectiveness concerned only themselves and 
affected only themselves. 
Today, however, the large knowledge organization is the central 
reality. Modern society is a society of large organized institutions. 
In every one of them, including the armed services, the 
center of gravity has shifted to the knowledge worker, the man 
who puts to work what he has between his ears rather than the 
brawn of his muscles or the skill of his hands. Increasingly, the 
majority of people who have been schooled to use knowledge, 
theory, and concept rather than physical force or manual skill 
work in an organization and are effective insofar as they can 
make a contribution to the organization.

are few things less pleasing to the Lord, and less productive, than 
an engineering department that rapidly turns out beautiful blueprints 
for the wrong product. Working on the right things is 
what makes knowledge work effective. This is not capable of 
being measured by any of the yardsticks for manual work. 
The knowledge worker cannot be supervised closely or in 
detail. He can only be helped. But he must direct himself, and he 
must direct himself toward performance and contribution, that 
is, toward effectiveness.

is meaningless data. The knowledge worker, therefore, must do 
something which a manual worker need not do. He must provide 
effectiveness. He cannot depend on the utility his output 
carries with it as does a well-made pair of shoes. 
The knowledge worker is the one “factor of production” 
through which the highly developed societies and economies of 
today—the United States, Western Europe, Japan, and also 
increasingly, the Soviet Union—become and remain competitive. 
• This is particularly true of the United States. The only resource in 
respect to which America can possibly have a competitive 
advantage is education. American education may leave a 
good deal to be desired, but it is massive beyond anything 
poorer societies can afford. For education is the most expensive 
capital investment we have ever known. A Ph.D. in the 
natural sciences represents $100,000 to $200,000 of social 
capital investment. Even the boy who graduates from college 
without any specific professional competence represents an 
investment of $50,000 or more. This only a very rich society 
can afford. 
Education is the one area, therefore, in which the richest 
of all societies, the United States, has a genuine advantage— 
provided it can make the knowledge worker productive. And 
productivity for the knowledge worker means the ability to 
get the right things done. It means effectiveness. 
WHO IS AN EXECUTIVE? 
Every knowledge worker in modern organization is an “executive” 
if, by virtue of his position or knowledge, he is responsible 
for a contribution that materially affects the capacity of the 
organization to perform and to obtain results, This may be the 
capacity of a business to bring out a new product or to obtain a 
E F F ECTI V ENE S S CAN B E L E A RNED 5?
6
larger share of a given market. It may be the capacity of a hospital 
to provide bedside care to its patients, and so on. Such a man 
(or woman) must make decisions; he cannot just carry out 
orders. He must take responsibility for his contribution. And he 
is supposed, by virtue of his knowledge, to be better equipped to 
make the right decision than anyone else. He may be overridden; 
he may be demoted or fired. But so long as he has the job the 
goals, the standards, and the contribution are in his keeping. 
Most managers are executives—though not all. But many 
nonmanagers are also becoming executives in modern society. 
For the knowledge organization, as we have been learning these 
last few years, needs both “managers” and “individual professional 
contributors” in positions of responsibility, decision-making, 
and authority. 
This fact is perhaps best illustrated by a recent newspaper 
interview with a young American infantry captain in the 
Vietnam jungle. 
• Asked by the reporter, “How in this confused situation can 
you retain command?” the young captain said: “Around 
here, I am only the guy who is responsible. If these men don’t 
know what to do when they run into an enemy in the jungle, 
I’m too far away to tell them. My job is to make sure they 
know. What they do depends on the situation which only 
they can judge. The responsibility is always mine, but the 
decision lies with whoever is on the spot.” 
In a guerrilla war, every man is an “executive.” 
There are many managers who are not executives. Many people, 
in other words, are superiors of other people—and often of 
fairly large numbers of other people—and still do not seriously 
affect the ability of the organization to perform. Most foremen 
in a manufacturing plant belong here. They are “overseers” in the 
literal sense of the word. 

Preface 
Management books usually deal with managing other people. The 
subject of this book is managing oneself for effectiveness. That one can 
truly manage other people is by no means adequately proven. But one 
can always manage oneself. Indeed, executives who do not manage 
themselves for effectiveness cannot possibly expect to manage their 
associates and subordinates. Management is largely by example. 
Executives who do not know how to make themselves effective in their 
own job and work set the wrong example. 
To be reasonably effective it is not enough for the individual to be 
intelligent, to work hard or to be knowledgeable. Effectiveness is something 
separate, something different. But to be effective also does not 
require special gifts, special aptitude, or special training. Effectiveness 
as an executive demands doing certain—and fairly simple—things. It 
consists of a small number of practices, the practices that are presented 
and discussed in this book. But these practices are not “inborn.” In 
forty-five years of work as a consultant with a large number of executives 
in a wide variety of organizations—large and small; businesses, 
government agencies, labor unions, hospitals, universities, community 
services; American, European, Latin American and Japanese—I have 
not come across a single “natural”: an executive who was born effective. 
All the effective ones have had to learn to be effective. And all of 
them then had to practice effectiveness until it became habit. But all 
the ones who worked on making themselves effective executives succeeded 
in doing so. Effectiveness can be learned—and it also has to be 
learned. 
Effectiveness is what executives are being paid for, whether they 
work as managers who are responsible for the performance of others as?
viii 
well as their own, or as individual professional contributors responsible 
for their own performance only. Without effectiveness there is no “performance,” 
no matter how much intelligence and knowledge goes into 
the work, no matter how many hours it takes. Yet it is perhaps not too 
surprising that we have so far paid little attention to the effective executive. 
Organizations—whether business enterprises, large government 
agencies, labor unions, large hospitals or large universities—are, after 
all, brand new. A century ago almost no one had even much contact 
with such organizations beyond an occasional trip to the local post 
office to mail a letter. And effectiveness as an executive means effectiveness 
in and through an organization. Until recently there was little 
reason for anyone to pay much attention to the effective executive or 
to worry about the low effectiveness of so many of them. Now, however, 
most people—especially those with even a fair amount of schooling—
can expect to spend all their working lives in an organization of 
some kind. Society has become a society of organizations in all developed 
countries. Now the effectiveness of the individual depends 
increasingly on his or her ability to be effective in an organization, to 
be effective as an executive. And the effectiveness of a modern society 
and its ability to perform—perhaps even its ability to survive—depend 
increasingly on the effectiveness of the people who work as executives 
in the organizations. The effective executive is fast becoming a key 
resource for society, and effectiveness as an executive a prime requirement 
for individual accomplishment and achievement—for young 
people at the beginning of their working lives fully as much as for people 
in mid-career.

1: Effectiveness Can Be 
Learned 
To be effective is the job of the executive. “To effect” and “to execute” 
are, after all, near-synonyms. Whether he works in a business 
or in a hospital, in a government agency or in a labor union, 
in a university or in the army, the executive is, first of all, 
expected to get the right things done. And this is simply that he is 
expected to be effective. 
Yet men of high effectiveness are conspicuous by their 
absence in executive jobs. High intelligence is common enough 
among executives. Imagination is far from rare. The level of 
knowledge tends to be high. But there seems to be little correlation 
between a man’s effectiveness and his intelligence, his imagination 
or his knowledge. Brilliant men are often strikingly ineffectual; 
they fail to realize that the brilliant insight is not by itself 
achievement. They never have learned that insights become 
effectiveness only through hard systematic work. Conversely, in 
every organization there are some highly effective plodders. 
While others rush around in the frenzy and busyness which very 
bright people so often confuse with “creativity,” the plodder puts 
one foot in front of the other and gets there first, like the tortoise 
in the old fable. 
Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential 
resources, but only effectiveness converts them into results. By 
themselves, they only set limits to what can be attained.

WHY WE NEED EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVES 
All this should be obvious. But why then has so little attention 
been paid to effectiveness, in an age in which there are 
mountains of books and articles on every other aspect of the 
executive’s tasks? 
One reason for this neglect is that effectiveness is the specific 
technology of the knowledge worker within an organization. 
Until recently, there was no more than a handful of these 
around. 
For manual work, we need only efficiency; that is, the ability 
to do things right rather than the ability to get the right things 
done. The manual worker can always be judged in terms of the 
quantity and quality of a definable and discrete output, such as a 
pair of shoes. We have learned how to measure efficiency and 
how to define quality in manual work during the last hundred 
years—to the point where we have been able to multiply the output 
of the individual worker tremendously. 
Formerly, the manual worker—whether machine operator or 
front-line soldier—predominated in all organizations. Few people 
of effectiveness were needed: those at the top who gave the 
orders that others carded out. They were so small a fraction of 
the total work population that we could, rightly or wrongly, take 
their effectiveness for granted. We could depend on the supply of 
“naturals,” the few people in any area of human endeavor who 
somehow know what the rest of us have to learn the hard way.

effectiveness. He cannot depend on the utility his output 
carries with it as does a well-made pair of shoes.

today—the United States, Western Europe, Japan, and also

respect to which America can possibly have a competitive 
advantage is education. American education may leave a 
good deal to be desired, but it is massive beyond anything 
poorer societies can afford. For education is the most expensive 
capital investment we have ever known. A Ph.D. in the 
natural sciences represents $100,000 to $200,000 of social 
capital investment. Even the boy who graduates from college 
without any specific professional competence represents an 
investment of $50,000 or more. This only a very rich society 
can afford. 
Education is the one area, therefore, in which the richest 
of all societies, the United States, has a genuine advantage— 
provided it can make the knowledge worker productive. And 
productivity for the knowledge worker means the ability to 
get the right things done. It means effectiveness. 
WHO IS AN EXECUTIVE? 
Every knowledge worker in modern organization is an “executive” 
if, by virtue of his position or knowledge, he is responsible 
for a contribution that materially affects the capacity of the 
organization to perform and to obtain results, This may be the 
capacity of a business to bring out a new product or to obtain a 
E F F ECTI V ENE S S CAN B E L E A RNED 5?

larger share of a given market. It may be the capacity of a hospital 
to provide bedside care to its patients, and so on. Such a man 
(or woman) must make decisions; he cannot just carry out 
orders. He must take responsibility for his contribution. And he 
is supposed, by virtue of his knowledge, to be better equipped to 
make the right decision than anyone else. He may be overridden; 
he may be demoted or fired. But so long as he has the job the 
goals, the standards, and the contribution are in his keeping. 
Most managers are executives—though not all. But many 
nonmanagers are also becoming executives in modern society. 
For the knowledge organization, as we have been learning these 
last few years, needs both “managers” and “individual professional 
contributors” in positions of responsibility, decision-making, 
and authority. 
This fact is perhaps best illustrated by a recent newspaper 
interview with a young American infantry captain in the 
Vietnam jungle. 
• Asked by the reporter, “How in this confused situation can 
you retain command?” the young captain said: “Around 
here, I am only the guy who is responsible. If these men don’t 
know what to do when they run into an enemy in the jungle, 
I’m too far away to tell them. My job is to make sure they 
know. What they do depends on the situation which only 
they can judge. The responsibility is always mine, but the 
decision lies with whoever is on the spot.” 
In a guerrilla war, every man is an “executive.” 
There are many managers who are not executives. Many people, 
in other words, are superiors of other people—and often of 
fairly large numbers of other people—and still do not seriously 
affect the ability of the organization to perform. Most foremen 
in a manufacturing plant belong here. They are “overseers” in the 
literal sense of the word. 

Preface 
Management books usually deal with managing other people. The 
subject of this book is managing oneself for effectiveness. That one can 
truly manage other people is by no means adequately proven. But one 
can always manage oneself. Indeed, executives who do not manage 
themselves for effectiveness cannot possibly expect to manage their 
associates and subordinates. Management is largely by example. 
Executives who do not know how to make themselves effective in their 
own job and work set the wrong example. 
To be reasonably effective it is not enough for the individual to be 
intelligent, to work hard or to be knowledgeable. Effectiveness is something 
separate, something different. But to be effective also does not 
require special gifts, special aptitude, or special training. Effectiveness 
as an executive demands doing certain—and fairly simple—things. It 
consists of a small number of practices, the practices that are presented 
and discussed in this book. But these practices are not “inborn.” In 
forty-five years of work as a consultant with a large number of executives 
in a wide variety of organizations—large and small; businesses, 
government agencies, labor unions, hospitals, universities, community 
services; American, European, Latin American and Japanese—I have 
not come across a single “natural”: an executive who was born effective. 
All the effective ones have had to learn to be effective. And all of 
them then had to practice effectiveness until it became habit. But all 
the ones who worked on making themselves effective executives succeeded 
in doing so. Effectiveness can be learned—and it also has to be 
learned. 
Effectiveness is what executives are being paid for, whether they 
work as managers who are responsible for the performance of others as?
viii 
well as their own, or as individual professional contributors responsible 
for their own performance only. Without effectiveness there is no “performance,” 
no matter how much intelligence and knowledge goes into 
the work, no matter how many hours it takes. Yet it is perhaps not too 
surprising that we have so far paid little attention to the effective executive. 
Organizations—whether business enterprises, large government 
agencies, labor unions, large hospitals or large universities—are, after 
all, brand new. A century ago almost no one had even much contact 
with such organizations beyond an occasional trip to the local post 
office to mail a letter. And effectiveness as an executive means effectiveness 
in and through an organization. Until recently there was little 
reason for anyone to pay much attention to the effective executive or 
to worry about the low effectiveness of so many of them. Now, however, 
most people—especially those with even a fair amount of schooling—
can expect to spend all their working lives in an organization of 
some kind. Society has become a society of organizations in all developed 
countries. Now the effectiveness of the individual depends 
increasingly on his or her ability to be effective in an organization, to 
be effective as an executive. And the effectiveness of a modern society 
and its ability to perform—perhaps even its ability to survive—depend 
increasingly on the effectiveness of the people who work as executives 
in the organizations. The effective executive is fast becoming a key 
resource for society, and effectiveness as an executive a prime requirement 
for individual accomplishment and achievement—for young 
people at the beginning of their working lives fully as much as for people 
in mid-career.

1: Effectiveness Can Be 
Learned 
To be effective is the job of the executive. “To effect” and “to execute” 
are, after all, near-synonyms. Whether he works in a business 
or in a hospital, in a government agency or in a labor union, 
in a university or in the army, the executive is, first of all, 
expected to get the right things done. And this is simply that he is 
expected to be effective. 
Yet men of high effectiveness are conspicuous by their 
absence in executive jobs. High intelligence is common enough 
among executives. Imagination is far from rare. The level of 
knowledge tends to be high. But there seems to be little correlation 
between a man’s effectiveness and his intelligence, his imagination 
or his knowledge. Brilliant men are often strikingly ineffectual; 
they fail to realize that the brilliant insight is not by itself 
achievement. They never have learned that insights become 
effectiveness only through hard systematic work. Conversely, in 
every organization there are some highly effective plodders. 
While others rush around in the frenzy and busyness which very 
bright people so often confuse with “creativity,” the plodder puts 
one foot in front of the other and gets there first, like the tortoise 
in the old fable. 
Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential 
resources, but only effectiveness converts them into results. By 
themselves, they only set limits to what can be attained.

WHY WE NEED EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVES 
All this should be obvious. But why then has so little attention 
been paid to effectiveness, in an age in which there are 
mountains of books and articles on every other aspect of the 
executive’s tasks? 
One reason for this neglect is that effectiveness is the specific 
technology of the knowledge worker within an organization. 
Until recently, there was no more than a handful of these 
around. 
For manual work, we need only efficiency; that is, the ability 
to do things right rather than the ability to get the right things 
done. The manual worker can always be judged in terms of the 
quantity and quality of a definable and discrete output, such as a 
pair of shoes. We have learned how to measure efficiency and 
how to define quality in manual work during the last hundred 
years—to the point where we have been able to multiply the output 
of the individual worker tremendously. 
Formerly, the manual worker—whether machine operator or 
front-line soldier—predominated in all organizations. Few people 
of effectiveness were needed: those at the top who gave the 
orders that others carded out. They were so small a fraction of 
the total work population that we could, rightly or wrongly, take 
their effectiveness for granted. We could depend on the supply of 
“naturals,” the few people in any area of human endeavor who 
somehow know what the rest of us have to learn the hard way. 
• This was true not only of business and the army. It is hard to 
realize today that “government” during the American Civil 
War a hundred years ago meant the merest handful of people. 
Lincoln’s Secretary of War had fewer than fifty civilian 
subordinates, most of them not “executives” and policy-makers 
but telegraph clerks. The entire Washington establishment 
of the U.S. government in Theodore Roosevelt’s time, 
THE EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVE?
around 1900, could be comfortably housed in any one of the 
government buildings along the Mall today. 
The hospital of yesterday did not know any of the 
“health-service professionals,” the X-ray and lab technicians, 
the dieticians and therapists, the social workers, and so on, of 
whom it now employs as many as two hundred and fifty for 
every one hundred patients. Apart from a few nurses, there 
were only cleaning women, cooks, and maids. The physician 
was the knowledge worker, with the nurse as his aide. 
In other words, up to recent times, the major problem of 
organization was efficiency in the performance of the manual 
worker who did what he had been told to do. Knowledge 
workers were not predominant in organization. 
In fact, only a small fraction of the knowledge workers of 
earlier days were part of an organization. Most of them worked 
by themselves as professionals, at best with a clerk. Their effectiveness 
or lack of effectiveness concerned only themselves and 
affected only themselves. 
Today, however, the large knowledge organization is the central 
reality. Modern society is a society of large organized institutions. 
In every one of them, including the armed services, the 
center of gravity has shifted to the knowledge worker, the man 
who puts to work what he has between his ears rather than the 
brawn of his muscles or the skill of his hands. Increasingly, the 
majority of people who have been schooled to use knowledge, 
theory, and concept rather than physical force or manual skill 
work in an organization and are effective insofar as they can 
make a contribution to the organization. 
Now effectiveness can no longer be taken for granted. Now it 
can no longer be neglected. 
The imposing system of measurements and tests which we 
have developed for manual work—from industrial engineering 
E F F ECTI V ENE S S CAN B E L E A RNED 3?
4
to quality control—is not applicable to knowledge work. There 
are few things less pleasing to the Lord, and less productive, than 
an engineering department that rapidly turns out beautiful blueprints 
for the wrong product. Working on the right things is 
what makes knowledge work effective. This is not capable of 
being measured by any of the yardsticks for manual work. 
The knowledge worker cannot be supervised closely or in 
detail. He can only be helped. But he must direct himself, and he 
must direct himself toward performance and contribution, that 
is, toward effectiveness. 
• A cartoon in The New Yorker magazine some time ago showed an 
office on the door of which was the legend: Chas. Smith, 
General Sales Manager, Ajax Soap Company. The walls were 
bare except for a big sign saying Think. The man in the 
office had his feet propped up on his desk and was blowing 
smoke rings at the ceiling. Outside two older men went by, 
the one saying to the other: “But how can we be sure that 
Smith thinks soap?” 
One can indeed never be sure what the knowledge worker 
thinks—and yet thinking is his specific work; it is his “doing.”

Preface 
Management books usually deal with managing other people. The 
subject of this book is managing oneself for effectiveness. That one can 
truly manage other people is by no means adequately proven. But one 
can always manage oneself. Indeed, executives who do not manage 
themselves for effectiveness cannot possibly expect to manage their 
associates and subordinates. Management is largely by example. 
Executives who do not know how to make themselves effective in their 
own job and work set the wrong example. 
To be reasonably effective it is not enough for the individual to be 
intelligent, to work hard or to be knowledgeable. Effectiveness is something 
separate, something different. But to be effective also does not 
require special gifts, special aptitude, or special training. Effectiveness 
as an executive demands doing certain—and fairly simple—things. It 
consists of a small number of practices, the practices that are presented 
and discussed in this book. But these practices are not “inborn.” In 
forty-five years of work as a consultant with a large number of executives 
in a wide variety of organizations—large and small; businesses, 
government agencies, labor unions, hospitals, universities, community 
services; American, European, Latin American and Japanese—I have 
not come across a single “natural”: an executive who was born effective. 
All the effective ones have had to learn to be effective. And all of 
them then had to practice effectiveness until it became habit. But all 
the ones who worked on making themselves effective executives succeeded 
in doing so. Effectiveness can be learned—and it also has to be 
learned. 
Effectiveness is what executives are being paid for, whether they 
work as managers who are responsible for the performance of others as?
viii 
well as their own, or as individual professional contributors responsible 
for their own performance only. Without effectiveness there is no “performance,” 
no matter how much intelligence and knowledge goes into 
the work, no matter how many hours it takes. Yet it is perhaps not too 
surprising that we have so far paid little attention to the effective executive. 
Organizations—whether business enterprises, large government 
agencies, labor unions, large hospitals or large universities—are, after 
all, brand new. A century ago almost no one had even much contact 
with such organizations beyond an occasional trip to the local post 
office to mail a letter. And effectiveness as an executive means effectiveness 
in and through an organization. Until recently there was little 
reason for anyone to pay much attention to the effective executive or 
to worry about the low effectiveness of so many of them. Now, however, 
most people—especially those with even a fair amount of schooling—
can expect to spend all their working lives in an organization of 
some kind. Society has become a society of organizations in all developed 
countries. Now the effectiveness of the individual depends 
increasingly on his or her ability to be effective in an organization, to 
be effective as an executive. And the effectiveness of a modern society 
and its ability to perform—perhaps even its ability to survive—depend 
increasingly on the effectiveness of the people who work as executives 
in the organizations. The effective executive is fast becoming a key 
resource for society, and effectiveness as an executive a prime requirement 
for individual accomplishment and achievement—for young 
people at the beginning of their working lives fully as much as for people 
in mid-career.

1: Effectiveness Can Be 
Learned 
To be effective is the job of the executive. “To effect” and “to execute” 
are, after all, near-synonyms. Whether he works in a business 
or in a hospital, in a government agency or in a labor union, 
in a university or in the army, the executive is, first of all, 
expected to get the right things done. And this is simply that he is 
expected to be effective. 
Yet men of high effectiveness are conspicuous by their 
absence in executive jobs. High intelligence is common enough 
among executives. Imagination is far from rare. The level of 
knowledge tends to be high. But there seems to be little correlation 
between a man’s effectiveness and his intelligence, his imagination 
or his knowledge. Brilliant men are often strikingly ineffectual; 
they fail to realize that the brilliant insight is not by itself 
achievement. They never have learned that insights become 
effectiveness only through hard systematic work. Conversely, in 
every organization there are some highly effective plodders. 
While others rush around in the frenzy and busyness which very 
bright people so often confuse with “creativity,” the plodder puts 
one foot in front of the other and gets there first, like the tortoise 
in the old fable. 
Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential 
resources, but only effectiveness converts them into results. By 
themselves, they only set limits to what can be attained.

WHY WE NEED EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVES 
All this should be obvious. But why then has so little attention 
been paid to effectiveness, in an age in which there are 
mountains of books and articles on every other aspect of the 
executive’s tasks? 
One reason for this neglect is that effectiveness is the specific 
technology of the knowledge worker within an organization. 
Until recently, there was no more than a handful of these 
around. 
For manual work, we need only efficiency; that is, the ability 
to do things right rather than the ability to get the right things 
done. The manual worker can always be judged in terms of the 
quantity and quality of a definable and discrete output, such as a 
pair of shoes. We have learned how to measure efficiency and 
how to define quality in manual work during the last hundred 
years—to the point where we have been able to multiply the output 
of the individual worker tremendously. 
Formerly, the manual worker—whether machine operator or 
front-line soldier—predominated in all organizations. Few people 
of effectiveness were needed: those at the top who gave the 
orders that others carded out. They were so small a fraction of 
the total work population that we could, rightly or wrongly, take 
their effectiveness for granted. We could depend on the supply of 
“naturals,” the few people in any area of human endeavor who 
somehow know what the rest of us have to learn the hard way. 
• This was true not only of business and the army. It is hard to 
realize today that “government” during the American Civil 
War a hundred years ago meant the merest handful of people. 
Lincoln’s Secretary of War had fewer than fifty civilian 
subordinates, most of them not “executives” and policy-makers 
but telegraph clerks. The entire Washington establishment 
of the U.S. government in Theodore Roosevelt’s time, 
THE EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVE?
around 1900, could be comfortably housed in any one of the 
government buildings along the Mall today. 
The hospital of yesterday did not know any of the 
“health-service professionals,” the X-ray and lab technicians, 
the dieticians and therapists, the social workers, and so on, of 
whom it now employs as many as two hundred and fifty for 
every one hundred patients. Apart from a few nurses, there 
were only cleaning women, cooks, and maids. The physician 
was the knowledge worker, with the nurse as his aide. 
In other words, up to recent times, the major problem of 
organization was efficiency in the performance of the manual 
worker who did what he had been told to do. Knowledge 
workers were not predominant in organization. 
In fact, only a small fraction of the knowledge workers of 
earlier days were part of an organization. Most of them worked 
by themselves as professionals, at best with a clerk. Their effectiveness 
or lack of effectiveness concerned only themselves and 
affected only themselves. 
Today, however, the large knowledge organization is the central 
reality. Modern society is a society of large organized institutions. 
In every one of them, including the armed services, the 
center of gravity has shifted to the knowledge worker, the man 
who puts to work what he has between his ears rather than the 
brawn of his muscles or the skill of his hands. Increasingly, the 
majority of people who have been schooled to use knowledge, 
theory, and concept rather than physical force or manual skill 
work in an organization and are effective insofar as they can 
make a contribution to the organization. 
Now effectiveness can no longer be taken for granted. Now it 
can no longer be neglected. 
The imposing system of measurements and tests which we 
have developed for manual work—from industrial engineering 
E F F ECTI V ENE S S CAN B E L E A RNED 3?
4
to quality control—is not applicable to knowledge work. There 
are few things less pleasing to the Lord, and less productive, than 
an engineering department that rapidly turns out beautiful blueprints 
for the wrong product. Working on the right things is 
what makes knowledge work effective. This is not capable of 
being measured by any of the yardsticks for manual work. 
The knowledge worker cannot be supervised closely or in 
detail. He can only be helped. But he must direct himself, and he 
must direct himself toward performance and contribution, that 
is, toward effectiveness. 
• A cartoon in The New Yorker magazine some time ago showed an 
office on the door of which was the legend: Chas. Smith, 
General Sales Manager, Ajax Soap Company. The walls were 
bare except for a big sign saying Think. The man in the 
office had his feet propped up on his desk and was blowing 
smoke rings at the ceiling. Outside two older men went by, 
the one saying to the other: “But how can we be sure that 
Smith thinks soap?” 
One can indeed never be sure what the knowledge worker 
thinks—and yet thinking is his specific work; it is his “doing.” 
The motivation of the knowledge worker depends on his 
* If effectiveness is 
lacking in his work, his commitment to work and to contribution 
will soon wither, and he will become a time-server going 
through the motions from 9 to 5. 
The knowledge worker does not produce something that is 
effective by itself. He does not produce a physical product —a 
ditch, a pair of shoes, a machine part. He produces knowledge, 
ideas, information. By themselves these “products” are useless. 
Somebody else, another man of knowledge, has to take them as 
his input and convert them into his output before they have any 
reality. The greatest wisdom not applied to action and behavior

is meaningless data. The knowledge worker, therefore, must do 
something which a manual worker need not do. He must provide 
effectiveness. He cannot depend on the utility his output 
carries with it as does a well-made pair of shoes. 
The knowledge worker is the one “factor of production” 
through which the highly developed societies and economies of 
today—the United States, Western Europe, Japan, and also 
increasingly, the Soviet Union—become and remain competitive. 
• This is particularly true of the United States. The only resource in 
respect to which America can possibly have a competitive 
advantage is education. American education may leave a 
good deal to be desired, but it is massive beyond anything 
poorer societies can afford. For education is the most expensive 
capital investment we have ever known. A Ph.D. in the 
natural sciences represents $100,000 to $200,000 of social 
capital investment. Even the boy who graduates from college 
without any specific professional competence represents an 
investment of $50,000 or more. This only a very rich society 
can afford. 
Education is the one area, therefore, in which the richest 
of all societies, the United States, has a genuine advantage— 
provided it can make the knowledge worker productive. And 
productivity for the knowledge worker means the ability to 
get the right things done. It means effectiveness. 
WHO IS AN EXECUTIVE? 
Every knowledge worker in modern organization is an “executive” 
if, by virtue of his position or knowledge, he is responsible 
for a contribution that materially affects the capacity of the 
organization to perform and to obtain results, This may be the 
capacity of a business to bring out a new product or to obtain a 
E F F ECTI V ENE S S CAN B E L E A RNED 5?
6
larger share of a given market. It may be the capacity of a hospital 
to provide bedside care to its patients, and so on. Such a man 
(or woman) must make decisions; he cannot just carry out 
orders. He must take responsibility for his contribution. And he 
is supposed, by virtue of his knowledge, to be better equipped to 
make the right decision than anyone else. He may be overridden; 
he may be demoted or fired. But so long as he has the job the 
goals, the standards, and the contribution are in his keeping. 
Most managers are executives—though not all. But many 
nonmanagers are also becoming executives in modern society. 
For the knowledge organization, as we have been learning these 
last few years, needs both “managers” and “individual professional 
contributors” in positions of responsibility, decision-making, 
and authority. 
This fact is perhaps best illustrated by a recent newspaper 
interview with a young American infantry captain in the 
Vietnam jungle. 
• Asked by the reporter, “How in this confused situation can 
you retain command?” the young captain said: “Around 
here, I am only the guy who is responsible. If these men don’t 
know what to do when they run into an enemy in the jungle, 
I’m too far away to tell them. My job is to make sure they 
know. What they do depends on the situation which only 
they can judge. The responsibility is always mine, but the 
decision lies with whoever is on the spot.” 
In a guerrilla war, every man is an “executive.” 
There are many managers who are not executives. Many people, 
in other words, are superiors of other people—and often of 
fairly large numbers of other people—and still do not seriously 
affect the ability of the organization to perform. Most foremen

in a university or in the army, the executive is, first of all, 
expected to get the right things done. And this is simply that he is 
expected to be effective. 
Yet men of high effectiveness are conspicuous by their 
absence in executive jobs. High intelligence is common enough 
among executives. Imagination is far from rare. The level of 
knowledge tends to be high. But there seems to be little correlation 
between a man’s effectiveness and his intelligence, his imagination 
or his knowledge. Brilliant men are often strikingly ineffectual; 
they fail to realize that the brilliant insight is not by itself 
achievement. They never have learned that insights become 
effectiveness only through hard systematic work. Conversely, in 
every organization there are some highly effective plodders. 
While others rush around in the frenzy and busyness which very 
bright people so often confuse with “creativity,” the plodder puts 
one foot in front of the other and gets there first, like the tortoise 
in the old fable. 
Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential 
resources, but only effectiveness converts them into results. By 
themselves, they only set limits to what can be attained.

WHY WE NEED EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVES 
All this should be obvious. But why then has so little attention 
been paid to effectiveness, in an age in which there are 
mountains of books and articles on every other aspect of the 
executive’s tasks? 
One reason for this neglect is that effectiveness is the specific 
technology of the knowledge worker within an organization. 
Until recently, there was no more than a handful of these 
around. 
For manual work, we need only efficiency; that is, the ability 
to do things right rather than the ability to get the right things 
done. The manual worker can always be judged in terms of the 
quantity and quality of a definable and discrete output, such as a 
pair of shoes. We have learned how to measure efficiency and 
how to define quality in manual work during the last hundred 
years—to the point where we have been able to multiply the output 
of the individual worker tremendously. 
Formerly, the manual worker—whether machine operator or 
front-line soldier—predominated in all organizations. Few people 
of effectiveness were needed: those at the top who gave the 
orders that others carded out. They were so small a fraction of 
the total work population that we could, rightly or wrongly, take 
their effectiveness for granted. We could depend on the supply of 
“naturals,” the few people in any area of human endeavor who 
somehow know what the rest of us have to learn the hard way. 
• This was true not only of business and the army. It is hard to 
realize today that “government” during the American Civil 
War a hundred years ago meant the merest handful of people. 
Lincoln’s Secretary of War had fewer than fifty civilian 
subordinates, most of them not “executives” and policy-makers 
but telegraph clerks. The entire Washington establishment 
of the U.S. government in Theodore Roosevelt’s time, 
THE EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVE?
around 1900, could be comfortably housed in any one of the 
government buildings along the Mall today. 
The hospital of yesterday did not know any of the 
“health-service professionals,” the X-ray and lab technicians, 
the dieticians and therapists, the social workers, and so on, of 
whom it now employs as many as two hundred and fifty for 
every one hundred patients. Apart from a few nurses, there 
were only cleaning women, cooks, and maids. The physician 
was the knowledge worker, with the nurse as his aide. 
In other words, up to recent times, the major problem of 
organization was efficiency in the performance of the manual 
worker who did what he had been told to do. Knowledge 
workers were not predominant in organization. 
In fact, only a small fraction of the knowledge workers of 
earlier days were part of an organization. Most of them worked 
by themselves as professionals, at best with a clerk. Their effectiveness 
or lack of effectiveness concerned only themselves and 
affected only themselves. 
Today, however, the large knowledge organization is the central 
reality. Modern society is a society of large organized institutions. 
In every one of them, including the armed services, the 
center of gravity has shifted to the knowledge worker, the man 
who puts to work what he has between his ears rather than the 
brawn of his muscles or the skill of his hands. Increasingly, the 
majority of people who have been schooled to use knowledge, 
theory, and concept rather than physical force or manual skill 
work in an organization and are effective insofar as they can 
make a contribution to the organization. 
Now effectiveness can no longer be taken for granted. Now it 
can no longer be neglected. 
The imposing system of measurements and tests which we 
have developed for manual work—from industrial engineering 
E F F ECTI V ENE S S CAN B E L E A RNED 3?
4
to quality control—is not applicable to knowledge work. There 
are few things less pleasing to the Lord, and less productive, than 
an engineering department that rapidly turns out beautiful blueprints 
for the wrong product. Working on the right things is 
what makes knowledge work effective. This is not capable of 
being measured by any of the yardsticks for manual work. 
The knowledge worker cannot be supervised closely or in 
detail. He can only be helped. But he must direct himself, and he 
must direct himself toward performance and contribution, that 
is, toward effectiveness. 
• A cartoon in The New Yorker magazine some time ago showed an 
office on the door of which was the legend: Chas. Smith, 
General Sales Manager, Ajax Soap Company. The walls were 
bare except for a big sign saying Think. The man in the 
office had his feet propped up on his desk and was blowing 
smoke rings at the ceiling. Outside two older men went by, 
the one saying to the other: “But how can we be sure that 
Smith thinks soap?” 
One can indeed never be sure what the knowledge worker 
thinks—and yet thinking is his specific work; it is his “doing.” 
The motivation of the knowledge worker depends on his

lacking in his work, his commitment to work and to contribution 
will soon wither, and he will become a time-server going 
through the motions from 9 to 5. 
The knowledge worker does not produce something that is 
effective by itself. He does not produce a physical product —a 
ditch, a pair of shoes, a machine part. He produces knowledge, 
ideas, information. By themselves these “products” are useless. 
Somebody else, another man of knowledge, has to take them as 
his input and convert them into his output before they have any

is meaningless data. The knowledge worker, therefore, must do 
something which a manual worker need not do. He must provide 
effectiveness. He cannot depend on the utility his output 
carries with it as does a well-made pair of shoes. 
The knowledge worker is the one “factor of production” 
through which the highly developed societies and economies of 
today—the United States, Western Europe, Japan, and also 
increasingly, the Soviet Union—become and remain competitive. 
• This is particularly true of the United States. The only resource in 
respect to which America can possibly have a competitive 
advantage is education. American education may leave a 
good deal to be desired, but it is massive beyond anything 
poorer societies can afford. For education is the most expensive 
capital investment we have ever known. A Ph.D. in the 
natural sciences represents $100,000 to $200,000 of social 
capital investment. Even the boy who graduates from college 
without any specific professional competence represents an 
investment of $50,000 or more. This only a very rich society 
can afford. 
Education is the one area, therefore, in which the richest 
of all societies, the United States, has a genuine advantage— 
provided it can make the knowledge worker productive. And 
productivity for the knowledge worker means the ability to 
get the right things done. It means effectiveness. 
WHO IS AN EXECUTIVE? 
Every knowledge worker in modern organization is an “executive” 
if, by virtue of his position or knowledge, he is responsible 
for a contribution that materially affects the capacity of the 
organization to perform and to obtain results, This may be the 
capacity of a business to bring out a new product or to obtain a 
E F F ECTI V ENE S S CAN B E L E A RNED 5?
6
larger share of a given market. It may be the capacity of a hospital 
to provide bedside care to its patients, and so on. Such a man 
(or woman) must make decisions; he cannot just carry out 
orders. He must take responsibility for his contribution. And he 
is supposed, by virtue of his knowledge, to be better equipped to 
make the right decision than anyone else. He may be overridden; 
he may be demoted or fired. But so long as he has the job the 
goals, the standards, and the contribution are in his keeping. 
Most managers are executives—though not all. But many 
nonmanagers are also becoming executives in modern society. 
For the knowledge organization, as we have been learning these 
last few years, needs both “managers” and “individual professional 
contributors” in positions of responsibility, decision-making, 
and authority. 
This fact is perhaps best illustrated by a recent newspaper 
interview with a young American infantry captain in the 
Vietnam jungle. 
• Asked by the reporter, “How in this confused situation can 
you retain command?” the young captain said: “Around 
here, I am only the guy who is responsible. If these men don’t 
know what to do when they run into an enemy in the jungle, 
I’m too far away to tell them. My job is to make sure they 
know. What they do depends on the situation which only 
they can judge. The responsibility is always mine, but the 
decision lies with whoever is on the spot.” 
In a guerrilla war, every man is an “executive.” 
There are many managers who are not executives. Many people, 
in other words, are superiors of other people—and often of 
fairly large numbers of other people—and still do not seriously 
affect the ability of the organization to perform. Most foremen 
in a manufacturing plant belong here. They are “overseers” in the 
literal sense of the word. 

Preface 
Management books usually deal with managing other people. The 
subject of this book is managing oneself for effectiveness. That one can 
truly manage other people is by no means adequately proven. But one 
can always manage oneself. Indeed, executives who do not manage 
themselves for effectiveness cannot possibly expect to manage their 
associates and subordinates. Management is largely by example. 
Executives who do not know how to make themselves effective in their 
own job and work set the wrong example. 
To be reasonably effective it is not enough for the individual to be 
intelligent, to work hard or to be knowledgeable. Effectiveness is something 
separate, something different. But to be effective also does not 
require special gifts, special aptitude, or special training. Effectiveness 
as an executive demands doing certain—and fairly simple—things. It 
consists of a small number of practices, the practices that are presented 
and discussed in this book. But these practices are not “inborn.” In 
forty-five years of work as a consultant with a large number of executives 
in a wide variety of organizations—large and small; businesses, 
government agencies, labor unions, hospitals, universities, community 
services; American, European, Latin American and Japanese—I have 
not come across a single “natural”: an executive who was born effective. 
All the effective ones have had to learn to be effective. And all of 
them then had to practice effectiveness until it became habit. But all 
the ones who worked on making themselves effective executives succeeded 
in doing so. Effectiveness can be learned—and it also has to be 
learned. 
Effectiveness is what executives are being paid for, whether they 
work as managers who are responsible for the performance of others as?
viii 
well as their own, or as individual professional contributors responsible 
for their own performance only. Without effectiveness there is no “performance,” 
no matter how much intelligence and knowledge goes into 
the work, no matter how many hours it takes. Yet it is perhaps not too 
surprising that we have so far paid little attention to the effective executive. 
Organizations—whether business enterprises, large government 
agencies, labor unions, large hospitals or large universities—are, after 
all, brand new. A century ago almost no one had even much contact 
with such organizations beyond an occasional trip to the local post 
office to mail a letter. And effectiveness as an executive means effectiveness 
in and through an organization. Until recently there was little 
reason for anyone to pay much attention to the effective executive or 
to worry about the low effectiveness of so many of them. Now, however, 
most people—especially those with even a fair amount of schooling—
can expect to spend all their working lives in an organization of 
some kind. Society has become a society of organizations in all developed 
countries. Now the effectiveness of the individual depends 
increasingly on his or her ability to be effective in an organization, to 
be effective as an executive. And the effectiveness of a modern society 
and its ability to perform—perhaps even its ability to survive—depend 
increasingly on the effectiveness of the people who work as executives 
in the organizations. The effective executive is fast becoming a key 
resource for society, and effectiveness as an executive a prime requirement 
for individual accomplishment and achievement—for young 
people at the beginning of their working lives fully as much as for people 
in mid-career.

or lack of effectiveness concerned only themselves and 
affected only themselves. 
Today, however, the large knowledge organization is the central 
reality. Modern society is a society of large organized institutions. 
In every one of them, including the armed services, the 
center of gravity has shifted to the knowledge worker, the man 
who puts to work what he has between his ears rather than the 
brawn of his muscles or the skill of his hands. Increasingly, the 
majority of people who have been schooled to use knowledge, 
theory, and concept rather than physical force or manual skill 
work in an organization and are effective insofar as they can 
make a contribution to the organization. 
Now effectiveness can no longer be taken for granted. Now it 
can no longer be neglected. 
The imposing system of measurements and tests which we 
have developed for manual work—from industrial engineering

to quality control—is not applicable to knowledge work. There 
are few things less pleasing to the Lord, and less productive, than 
an engineering department that rapidly turns out beautiful blueprints 
for the wrong product. Working on the right things is 
what makes knowledge work effective. This is not capable of 
being measured by any of the yardsticks for manual work. 
The knowledge worker cannot be supervised closely or in 
detail. He can only be helped. But he must direct himself, and he 
must direct himself toward performance and contribution, that 
is, toward effectiveness.

is meaningless data. The knowledge worker, therefore, must do 
something which a manual worker need not do. He must provide 
effectiveness. He cannot depend on the utility his output 
carries with it as does a well-made pair of shoes. 
The knowledge worker is the one “factor of production” 
through which the highly developed societies and economies of 
today—the United States, Western Europe, Japan, and also 
increasingly, the Soviet Union—become and remain competitive. 
• This is particularly true of the United States. The only resource in 
respect to which America can possibly have a competitive 
advantage is education. American education may leave a 
good deal to be desired, but it is massive beyond anything 
poorer societies can afford. For education is the most expensive 
capital investment we have ever known. A Ph.D. in the 
natural sciences represents $100,000 to $200,000 of social 
capital investment. Even the boy who graduates from college 
without any specific professional competence represents an 
investment of $50,000 or more. This only a very rich society 
can afford. 
Education is the one area, therefore, in which the richest 
of all societies, the United States, has a genuine advantage— 
provided it can make the knowledge worker productive. And 
productivity for the knowledge worker means the ability to 
get the right things done. It means effectiveness. 
WHO IS AN EXECUTIVE? 
Every knowledge worker in modern organization is an “executive” 
if, by virtue of his position or knowledge, he is responsible 
for a contribution that materially affects the capacity of the 
organization to perform and to obtain results, This may be the 
capacity of a business to bring out a new product or to obtain a 
E F F ECTI V ENE S S CAN B E L E A RNED 5?
6
larger share of a given market. It may be the capacity of a hospital 
to provide bedside care to its patients, and so on. Such a man 
(or woman) must make decisions; he cannot just carry out 
orders. He must take responsibility for his contribution. And he 
is supposed, by virtue of his knowledge, to be better equipped to 
make the right decision than anyone else. He may be overridden; 
he may be demoted or fired. But so long as he has the job the 
goals, the standards, and the contribution are in his keeping. 
Most managers are executives—though not all. But many 
nonmanagers are also becoming executives in modern society. 
For the knowledge organization, as we have been learning these 
last few years, needs both “managers” and “individual professional 
contributors” in positions of responsibility, decision-making, 
and authority. 
This fact is perhaps best illustrated by a recent newspaper 
interview with a young American infantry captain in the 
Vietnam jungle. 
• Asked by the reporter, “How in this confused situation can 
you retain command?” the young captain said: “Around 
here, I am only the guy who is responsible. If these men don’t 
know what to do when they run into an enemy in the jungle, 
I’m too far away to tell them. My job is to make sure they 
know. What they do depends on the situation which only 
they can judge. The responsibility is always mine, but the 
decision lies with whoever is on the spot.” 
In a guerrilla war, every man is an “executive.” 
There are many managers who are not executives. Many people, 
in other words, are superiors of other people—and often of 
fairly large numbers of other people—and still do not seriously 
affect the ability of the organization to perform. Most foremen 
in a manufacturing plant belong here. They are “overseers” in the 
literal sense of the word. 

Preface 
Management books usually deal with managing other people. The 
subject of this book is managing oneself for effectiveness. That one can 
truly manage other people is by no means adequately proven. But one 
can always manage oneself. Indeed, executives who do not manage 
themselves for effectiveness cannot possibly expect to manage their 
associates and subordinates. Management is largely by example. 
Executives who do not know how to make themselves effective in their 
own job and work set the wrong example. 
To be reasonably effective it is not enough for the individual to be 
intelligent, to work hard or to be knowledgeable. Effectiveness is something 
separate, something different. But to be effective also does not 
require special gifts, special aptitude, or special training. Effectiveness 
as an executive demands doing certain—and fairly simple—things. It 
consists of a small number of practices, the practices that are presented 
and discussed in this book. But these practices are not “inborn.” In 
forty-five years of work as a consultant with a large number of executives 
in a wide variety of organizations—large and small; businesses, 
government agencies, labor unions, hospitals, universities, community 
services; American, European, Latin American and Japanese—I have 
not come across a single “natural”: an executive who was born effective. 
All the effective ones have had to learn to be effective. And all of 
them then had to practice effectiveness until it became habit. But all 
the ones who worked on making themselves effective executives succeeded 
in doing so. Effectiveness can be learned—and it also has to be 
learned. 
Effectiveness is what executives are being paid for, whether they 
work as managers who are responsible for the performance of others as?
viii 
well as their own, or as individual professional contributors responsible 
for their own performance only. Without effectiveness there is no “performance,” 
no matter how much intelligence and knowledge goes into 
the work, no matter how many hours it takes. Yet it is perhaps not too 
surprising that we have so far paid little attention to the effective executive. 
Organizations—whether business enterprises, large government 
agencies, labor unions, large hospitals or large universities—are, after 
all, brand new. A century ago almost no one had even much contact 
with such organizations beyond an occasional trip to the local post 
office to mail a letter. And effectiveness as an executive means effectiveness 
in and through an organization. Until recently there was little 
reason for anyone to pay much attention to the effective executive or 
to worry about the low effectiveness of so many of them. Now, however, 
most people—especially those with even a fair amount of schooling—
can expect to spend all their working lives in an organization of 
some kind. Society has become a society of organizations in all developed 
countries. Now the effectiveness of the individual depends 
increasingly on his or her ability to be effective in an organization, to 
be effective as an executive. And the effectiveness of a modern society 
and its ability to perform—perhaps even its ability to survive—depend 
increasingly on the effectiveness of the people who work as executives 
in the organizations. The effective executive is fast becoming a key 
resource for society, and effectiveness as an executive a prime requirement 
for individual accomplishment and achievement—for young 
people at the beginning of their working lives fully as much as for people 
in mid-career.

1: Effectiveness Can Be 
Learned 
To be effective is the job of the executive. “To effect” and “to execute” 
are, after all, near-synonyms. Whether he works in a business 
or in a hospital, in a government agency or in a labor union, 
in a university or in the army, the executive is, first of all, 
expected to get the right things done. And this is simply that he is 
expected to be effective. 
Yet men of high effectiveness are conspicuous by their 
absence in executive jobs. High intelligence is common enough 
among executives. Imagination is far from rare. The level of 
knowledge tends to be high. But there seems to be little correlation 
between a man’s effectiveness and his intelligence, his imagination 
or his knowledge. Brilliant men are often strikingly ineffectual; 
they fail to realize that the brilliant insight is not by itself 
achievement. They never have learned that insights become 
effectiveness only through hard systematic work. Conversely, in 
every organization there are some highly effective plodders. 
While others rush around in the frenzy and busyness which very 
bright people so often confuse with “creativity,” the plodder puts 
one foot in front of the other and gets there first, like the tortoise 
in the old fable. 
Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential 
resources, but only effectiveness converts them into results. By 
themselves, they only set limits to what can be attained.

WHY WE NEED EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVES 
All this should be obvious. But why then has so little attention 
been paid to effectiveness, in an age in which there are 
mountains of books and articles on every other aspect of the 
executive’s tasks? 
One reason for this neglect is that effectiveness is the specific 
technology of the knowledge worker within an organization. 
Until recently, there was no more than a handful of these 
around. 
For manual work, we need only efficiency; that is, the ability 
to do things right rather than the ability to get the right things 
done. The manual worker can always be judged in terms of the 
quantity and quality of a definable and discrete output, such as a 
pair of shoes. We have learned how to measure efficiency and 
how to define quality in manual work during the last hundred 
years—to the point where we have been able to multiply the output 
of the individual worker tremendously. 
Formerly, the manual worker—whether machine operator or 
front-line soldier—predominated in all organizations. Few people 
of effectiveness were needed: those at the top who gave the 
orders that others carded out. They were so small a fraction of 
the total work population that we could, rightly or wrongly, take 
their effectiveness for granted. We could depend on the supply of 
“naturals,” the few people in any area of human endeavor who 
somehow know what the rest of us have to learn the hard way. 
• This was true not only of business and the army. It is hard to 
realize today that “government” during the American Civil 
War a hundred years ago meant the merest handful of people. 
Lincoln’s Secretary of War had fewer than fifty civilian 
subordinates, most of them not “executives” and policy-makers 
but telegraph clerks. The entire Washington establishment 
of the U.S. government in Theodore Roosevelt’s time, 
THE EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVE?
around 1900, could be comfortably housed in any one of the 
government buildings along the Mall today. 
The hospital of yesterday did not know any of the 
“health-service professionals,” the X-ray and lab technicians, 
the dieticians and therapists, the social workers, and so on, of 
whom it now employs as many as two hundred and fifty for 
every one hundred patients. Apart from a few nurses, there 
were only cleaning women, cooks, and maids. The physician 
was the knowledge worker, with the nurse as his aide. 
In other words, up to recent times, the major problem of 
organization was efficiency in the performance of the manual 
worker who did what he had been told to do. Knowledge 
workers were not predominant in organization. 
In fact, only a small fraction of the knowledge workers of 
earlier days were part of an organization. Most of them worked 
by themselves as professionals, at best with a clerk. Their effectiveness 
or lack of effectiveness concerned only themselves and 
affected only themselves.

of all societies, the United States, has a genuine advantage— 
provided it can make the knowledge worker productive. And 
productivity for the knowledge worker means the ability to 
get the right things done. It means effectiveness. 
WHO IS AN EXECUTIVE? 
Every knowledge worker in modern organization is an “executive” 
if, by virtue of his position or knowledge, he is responsible 
for a contribution that materially affects the capacity of the 
organization to perform and to obtain results, This may be the 
capacity of a business to bring out a new product or to obtain a

larger share of a given market. It may be the capacity of a hospital 
to provide bedside care to its patients, and so on. Such a man 
(or woman) must make decisions; he cannot just carry out 
orders. He must take responsibility for his contribution. And he 
is supposed, by virtue of his knowledge, to be better equipped to 
make the right decision than anyone else. He may be overridden; 
he may be demoted or fired. But so long as he has the job the 
goals, the standards, and the contribution are in his keeping. 
Most managers are executives—though not all. But many 
nonmanagers are also becoming executives in modern society. 
For the knowledge organization, as we have been learning these 
last few years, needs both “managers” and “individual professional 
contributors” in positions of responsibility, decision-making, 
and authority. 
This fact is perhaps best illustrated by a recent newspaper 
interview with a young American infantry captain in the 
Vietnam jungle. 
• Asked by the reporter, “How in this confused situation can 
you retain command?” the young captain said: “Around 
here, I am only the guy who is responsible. If these men don’t 
know what to do when they run into an enemy in the jungle, 
I’m too far away to tell them. My job is to make sure they 
know. What they do depends on the situation which only 
they can judge. The responsibility is always mine, but the 
decision lies with whoever is on the spot.” 
In a guerrilla war, every man is an “executive.” 
There are many managers who are not executives. Many people, 
in other words, are superiors of other people—and often of 
fairly large numbers of other people—and still do not seriously 
affect the ability of the organization to perform. Most foremen 
in a manufacturing plant belong here. They are “overseers” in the 
literal sense of the word. 

Preface 
Management books usually deal with managing other people. The 
subject of this book is managing oneself for effectiveness. That one can 
truly manage other people is by no means adequately proven. But one 
can always manage oneself. Indeed, executives who do not manage 
themselves for effectiveness cannot possibly expect to manage their 
associates and subordinates. Management is largely by example. 
Executives who do not know how to make themselves effective in their 
own job and work set the wrong example. 
To be reasonably effective it is not enough for the individual to be 
intelligent, to work hard or to be knowledgeable. Effectiveness is something 
separate, something different. But to be effective also does not 
require special gifts, special aptitude, or special training. Effectiveness 
as an executive demands doing certain—and fairly simple—things. It 
consists of a small number of practices, the practices that are presented 
and discussed in this book. But these practices are not “inborn.” In 
forty-five years of work as a consultant with a large number of executives 
in a wide variety of organizations—large and small; businesses, 
government agencies, labor unions, hospitals, universities, community 
services; American, European, Latin American and Japanese—I have 
not come across a single “natural”: an executive who was born effective. 
All the effective ones have had to learn to be effective. And all of 
them then had to practice effectiveness until it became habit. But all 
the ones who worked on making themselves effective executives succeeded 
in doing so. Effectiveness can be learned—and it also has to be 
learned. 
Effectiveness is what executives are being paid for, whether they 
work as managers who are responsible for the performance of others as?
viii 
well as their own, or as individual professional contributors responsible 
for their own performance only. Without effectiveness there is no “performance,” 
no matter how much intelligence and knowledge goes into 
the work, no matter how many hours it takes. Yet it is perhaps not too 
surprising that we have so far paid little attention to the effective executive. 
Organizations—whether business enterprises, large government 
agencies, labor unions, large hospitals or large universities—are, after 
all, brand new. A century ago almost no one had even much contact 
with such organizations beyond an occasional trip to the local post 
office to mail a letter. And effectiveness as an executive means effectiveness 
in and through an organization. Until recently there was little 
reason for anyone to pay much attention to the effective executive or 
to worry about the low effectiveness of so many of them. Now, however, 
most people—especially those with even a fair amount of schooling—
can expect to spend all their working lives in an organization of 
some kind. Society has become a society of organizations in all developed 
countries. Now the effectiveness of the individual depends 
increasingly on his or her ability to be effective in an organization, to 
be effective as an executive. And the effectiveness of a modern society 
and its ability to perform—perhaps even its ability to survive—depend 
increasingly on the effectiveness of the people who work as executives 
in the organizations. The effective executive is fast becoming a key 
resource for society, and effectiveness as an executive a prime requirement 
for individual accomplishment and achievement—for young 
people at the beginning of their working lives fully as much as for people 
in mid-career.

1: Effectiveness Can Be 
Learned 
To be effective is the job of the executive. “To effect” and “to execute” 
are, after all, near-synonyms. Whether he works in a business 
or in a hospital, in a government agency or in a labor union, 
in a university or in the army, the executive is, first of all, 
expected to get the right things done. And this is simply that he is 
expected to be effective. 
Yet men of high effectiveness are conspicuous by their 
absence in executive jobs. High intelligence is common enough 
among executives. Imagination is far from rare. The level of 
knowledge tends to be high. But there seems to be little correlation 
between a man’s effectiveness and his intelligence, his imagination 
or his knowledge. Brilliant men are often strikingly ineffectual; 
they fail to realize that the brilliant insight is not by itself 
achievement. They never have learned that insights become 
effectiveness only through hard systematic work. Conversely, in 
every organization there are some highly effective plodders. 
While others rush around in the frenzy and busyness which very 
bright people so often confuse with “creativity,” the plodder puts 
one foot in front of the other and gets there first, like the tortoise 
in the old fable. 
Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential 
resources, but only effectiveness converts them into results. By 
themselves, they only set limits to what can be attained.

WHY WE NEED EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVES 
All this should be obvious. But why then has so little attention 
been paid to effectiveness, in an age in which there are 
mountains of books and articles on every other aspect of the 
executive’s tasks? 
One reason for this neglect is that effectiveness is the specific 
technology of the knowledge worker within an organization. 
Until recently, there was no more than a handful of these 
around. 
For manual work, we need only efficiency; that is, the ability 
to do things right rather than the ability to get the right things 
done. The manual worker can always be judged in terms of the 
quantity and quality of a definable and discrete output, such as a 
pair of shoes. We have learned how to measure efficiency and 
how to define quality in manual work during the last hundred 
years—to the point where we have been able to multiply the output 
of the individual worker tremendously. 
Formerly, the manual worker—whether machine operator or 
front-line soldier—predominated in all organizations. Few people 
of effectiveness were needed: those at the top who gave the 
orders that others carded out. They were so small a fraction of 
the total work population that we could, rightly or wrongly, take 
their effectiveness for granted. We could depend on the supply of 
“naturals,” the few people in any area of human endeavor who 
somehow know what the rest of us have to learn the hard way. 
• This was true not only of business and the army. It is hard to 
realize today that “government” during the American Civil 
War a hundred years ago meant the merest handful of people. 
Lincoln’s Secretary of War had fewer than fifty civilian 
subordinates, most of them not “executives” and policy-makers 
but telegraph clerks. The entire Washington establishment 
of the U.S. government in Theodore Roosevelt’s time, 
THE EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVE?
around 1900, could be comfortably housed in any one of the 
government buildings along the Mall today. 
The hospital of yesterday did not know any of the 
“health-service professionals,” the X-ray and lab technicians, 
the dieticians and therapists, the social workers, and so on, of 
whom it now employs as many as two hundred and fifty for 
every one hundred patients. Apart from a few nurses, there 
were only cleaning women, cooks, and maids. The physician 
was the knowledge worker, with the nurse as his aide. 
In other words, up to recent times, the major problem of 
organization was efficiency in the performance of the manual 
worker who did what he had been told to do. Knowledge 
workers were not predominant in organization. 
In fact, only a small fraction of the knowledge workers of 
earlier days were part of an organization. Most of them worked 
by themselves as professionals, at best with a clerk. Their effectiveness 
or lack of effectiveness concerned only themselves and 
affected only themselves. 
Today, however, the large knowledge organization is the central 
reality. Modern society is a society of large organized institutions. 
In every one of them, including the armed services, the 
center of gravity has shifted to the knowledge worker, the man 
who puts to work what he has between his ears rather than the 
brawn of his muscles or the skill of his hands. Increasingly, the 
majority of people who have been schooled to use knowledge, 
theory, and concept rather than physical force or manual skill 
work in an organization and are effective insofar as they can 
make a contribution to the organization. 
Now effectiveness can no longer be taken for granted. Now it 
can no longer be neglected. 
The imposing system of measurements and tests which we 
have developed for manual work—from industrial engineering 
E F F ECTI V ENE S S CAN B E L E A RNED 3?
4
to quality control—is not applicable to knowledge work. There 
are few things less pleasing to the Lord, and less productive, than 
an engineering department that rapidly turns out beautiful blueprints 
for the wrong product. Working on the right things is 
what makes knowledge work effective. This is not capable of 
being measured by any of the yardsticks for manual work. 
The knowledge worker cannot be supervised closely or in 
detail. He can only be helped. But he must direct himself, and he 
must direct himself toward performance and contribution, that 
is, toward effectiveness. 
• A cartoon in The New Yorker magazine some time ago showed an 
office on the door of which was the legend: Chas. Smith, 
General Sales Manager, Ajax Soap Company. The walls were 
bare except for a big sign saying Think. The man in the 
office had his feet propped up on his desk and was blowing 
smoke rings at the ceiling. Outside two older men went by, 
the one saying to the other: “But how can we be sure that 
Smith thinks soap?” 
One can indeed never be sure what the knowledge worker 
thinks—and yet thinking is his specific work; it is his “doing.” 
The motivation of the knowledge worker depends on his

lacking in his work, his commitment to work and to contribution 
will soon wither, and he will become a time-server going 
through the motions from 9 to 5. 
The knowledge worker does not produce something that is 
effective by itself. He does not produce a physical product —a 
ditch, a pair of shoes, a machine part. He produces knowledge, 
ideas, information. By themselves these “products” are useless. 
Somebody else, another man of knowledge, has to take them as 
his input and convert them into his output before they have any 
reality. The greatest wisdom not applied to action and behavior

is meaningless data. The knowledge worker, therefore, must do 
something which a manual worker need not do. He must provide 
effectiveness. He cannot depend on the utility his output 
carries with it as does a well-made pair of shoes. 
The knowledge worker is the one “factor of production” 
through which the highly developed societies and economies of 
today—the United States, Western Europe, Japan, and also 
increasingly, the Soviet Union—become and remain competitive. 
• This is particularly true of the United States. The only resource in 
respect to which America can possibly have a competitive 
advantage is education. American education may leave a 
good deal to be desired, but it is massive beyond anything 
poorer societies can afford. For education is the most expensive 
capital investment we have ever known. A Ph.D. in the 
natural sciences represents $100,000 to $200,000 of social 
capital investment. Even the boy who graduates from college 
without any specific professional competence represents an 
investment of $50,000 or more. This only a very rich society 
can afford. 
Education is the one area, therefore, in which the richest 
of all societies, the United States, has a genuine advantage— 
provided it can make the knowledge worker productive. And 
productivity for the knowledge worker means the ability to 
get the right things done. It means effectiveness.

1: Effectiveness Can Be 
Learned 
To be effective is the job of the executive. “To effect” and “to execute” 
are, after all, near-synonyms. Whether he works in a business 
or in a hospital, in a government agency or in a labor union, 
in a university or in the army, the executive is, first of all, 
expected to get the right things done. And this is simply that he is 
expected to be effective. 
Yet men of high effectiveness are conspicuous by their 
absence in executive jobs. High intelligence is common enough 
among executives. Imagination is far from rare. The level of 
knowledge tends to be high. But there seems to be little correlation 
between a man’s effectiveness and his intelligence, his imagination 
or his knowledge. Brilliant men are often strikingly ineffectual; 
they fail to realize that the brilliant insight is not by itself 
achievement. They never have learned that insights become 
effectiveness only through hard systematic work. Conversely, in 
every organization there are some highly effective plodders. 
While others rush around in the frenzy and busyness which very 
bright people so often confuse with “creativity,” the plodder puts 
one foot in front of the other and gets there first, like the tortoise 
in the old fable. 
Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential 
resources, but only effectiveness converts them into results. By 
themselves, they only set limits to what can be attained.

WHY WE NEED EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVES 
All this should be obvious. But why then has so little attention 
been paid to effectiveness, in an age in which there are 
mountains of books and articles on every other aspect of the 
executive’s tasks? 
One reason for this neglect is that effectiveness is the specific 
technology of the knowledge worker within an organization. 
Until recently, there was no more than a handful of these 
around. 
For manual work, we need only efficiency; that is, the ability 
to do things right rather than the ability to get the right things 
done. The manual worker can always be judged in terms of the 
quantity and quality of a definable and discrete output, such as a 
pair of shoes. We have learned how to measure efficiency and 
how to define quality in manual work during the last hundred 
years—to the point where we have been able to multiply the output 
of the individual worker tremendously. 
Formerly, the manual worker—whether machine operator or 
front-line soldier—predominated in all organizations. Few people 
of effectiveness were needed: those at the top who gave the 
orders that others carded out. They were so small a fraction of 
the total work population that we could, rightly or wrongly, take 
their effectiveness for granted. We could depend on the supply of 
“naturals,” the few people in any area of human endeavor who 
somehow know what the rest of us have to learn the hard way. 
• This was true not only of business and the army. It is hard to 
realize today that “government” during the American Civil 
War a hundred years ago meant the merest handful of people. 
Lincoln’s Secretary of War had fewer than fifty civilian 
subordinates, most of them not “executives” and policy-makers 
but telegraph clerks. The entire Washington establishment 
of the U.S. government in Theodore Roosevelt’s time, 
THE EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVE?
around 1900, could be comfortably housed in any one of the 
government buildings along the Mall today. 
The hospital of yesterday did not know any of the 
“health-service professionals,” the X-ray and lab technicians, 
the dieticians and therapists, the social workers, and so on, of 
whom it now employs as many as two hundred and fifty for 
every one hundred patients. Apart from a few nurses, there 
were only cleaning women, cooks, and maids. The physician 
was the knowledge worker, with the nurse as his aide. 
In other words, up to recent times, the major problem of 
organization was efficiency in the performance of the manual 
worker who did what he had been told to do. Knowledge 
workers were not predominant in organization. 
In fact, only a small fraction of the knowledge workers of 
earlier days were part of an organization. Most of them worked 
by themselves as professionals, at best with a clerk. Their effectiveness 
or lack of effectiveness concerned only themselves and 
affected only themselves. 
Today, however, the large knowledge organization is the central 
reality. Modern society is a society of large organized institutions. 
In every one of them, including the armed services, the 
center of gravity has shifted to the knowledge worker, the man 
who puts to work what he has between his ears rather than the 
brawn of his muscles or the skill of his hands. Increasingly, the 
majority of people who have been schooled to use knowledge, 
theory, and concept rather than physical force or manual skill 
work in an organization and are effective insofar as they can 
make a contribution to the organization. 
Now effectiveness can no longer be taken for granted. Now it 
can no longer be neglected. 
The imposing system of measurements and tests which we 
have developed for manual work—from industrial engineering 
E F F ECTI V ENE S S CAN B E L E A RNED 3?
4
to quality control—is not applicable to knowledge work. There 
are few things less pleasing to the Lord, and less productive, than 
an engineering department that rapidly turns out beautiful blueprints 
for the wrong product. Working on the right things is 
what makes knowledge work effective. This is not capable of 
being measured by any of the yardsticks for manual work. 
The knowledge worker cannot be supervised closely or in 
detail. He can only be helped. But he must direct himself, and he 
must direct himself toward performance and contribution, that 
is, toward effectiveness. 
• A cartoon in The New Yorker magazine some time ago showed an 
office on the door of which was the legend: Chas. Smith, 
General Sales Manager, Ajax Soap Company. The walls were 
bare except for a big sign saying Think. The man in the 
office had his feet propped up on his desk and was blowing 
smoke rings at the ceiling. Outside two older men went by, 
the one saying to the other: “But how can we be sure that 
Smith thinks soap?” 
One can indeed never be sure what the knowledge worker 
thinks—and yet thinking is his specific work; it is his “doing.” 
The motivation of the knowledge worker depends on his

lacking in his work, his commitment to work and to contribution 
will soon wither, and he will become a time-server going 
through the motions from 9 to 5. 
The knowledge worker does not produce something that is 
effective by itself. He does not produce a physical product —a 
ditch, a pair of shoes, a machine part. He produces knowledge, 
ideas, information. By themselves these “products” are useless. 
Somebody else, another man of knowledge, has to take them as 
his input and convert them into his output before they have any 
reality. The greatest wisdom not applied to action and behavior

is meaningless data. The knowledge worker, therefore, must do 
something which a manual worker need not do. He must provide 
effectiveness. He cannot depend on the utility his output 
carries with it as does a well-made pair of shoes. 
The knowledge worker is the one “factor of production” 
through which the highly developed societies and economies of 
today—the United States, Western Europe, Japan, and also 
increasingly, the Soviet Union—become and remain competitive. 
• This is particularly true of the United States. The only resource in 
respect to which America can possibly have a competitive 
advantage is education. American education may leave a 
good deal to be desired, but it is massive beyond anything 
poorer societies can afford. For education is the most expensive 
capital investment we have ever known. A Ph.D. in the 
natural sciences represents $100,000 to $200,000 of social 
capital investment. Even the boy who graduates from college 
without any specific professional competence represents an 
investment of $50,000 or more. This only a very rich society 
can afford. 
Education is the one area, therefore, in which the richest 
of all societies, the United States, has a genuine advantage— 
provided it can make the knowledge worker productive. And 
productivity for the knowledge worker means the ability to 
get the right things done. It means effectiveness. 
WHO IS AN EXECUTIVE? 
Every knowledge worker in modern organization is an “executive” 
if, by virtue of his position or knowledge, he is responsible 
for a contribution that materially affects the capacity of the 
organization to perform and to obtain results, This may be the 
capacity of a business to bring out a new product or to obtain a 
E F F ECTI V ENE S S CAN B E L E A RNED 5?
6
larger share of a given market. It may be the capacity of a hospital 
to provide bedside care to its patients, and so on. Such a man 
(or woman) must make decisions; he cannot just carry out 
orders. He must take responsibility for his contribution. And he 
is supposed, by virtue of his knowledge, to be better equipped to 
make the right decision than anyone else. He may be overridden; 
he may be demoted or fired. But so long as he has the job the 
goals, the standards, and the contribution are in his keeping. 
Most managers are executives—though not all. But many 
nonmanagers are also becoming executives in modern society. 
For the knowledge organization, as we have been learning these 
last few years, needs both “managers” and “individual professional 
contributors” in positions of responsibility, decision-making, 
and authority. 
This fact is perhaps best illustrated by a recent newspaper 
interview with a young American infantry captain in the 
Vietnam jungle. 
• Asked by the reporter, “How in this confused situation can 
you retain command?” the young captain said: “Around 
here, I am only the guy who is responsible. If these men don’t 
know what to do when they run into an enemy in the jungle, 
I’m too far away to tell them. My job is to make sure they 
know. What they do depends on the situation which only 
they can judge. The responsibility is always mine, but the 
decision lies with whoever is on the spot.” 
In a guerrilla war, every man is an “executive.” 
There are many managers who are not executives. Many people, 
in other words, are superiors of other people—and often of 
fairly large numbers of other people—and still do not seriously 
affect the ability of the organization to perform. Most foremen 
in a manufacturing plant belong here. They are “overseers” in the 
literal sense of the word. 

Preface 
Management books usually deal with managing other people. The 
subject of this book is managing oneself for effectiveness. That one can 
truly manage other people is by no means adequately proven. But one 
can always manage oneself. Indeed, executives who do not manage 
themselves for effectiveness cannot possibly expect to manage their 
associates and subordinates. Management is largely by example. 
Executives who do not know how to make themselves effective in their 
own job and work set the wrong example. 
To be reasonably effective it is not enough for the individual to be 
intelligent, to work hard or to be knowledgeable. Effectiveness is something 
separate, something different. But to be effective also does not 
require special gifts, special aptitude, or special training. Effectiveness 
as an executive demands doing certain—and fairly simple—things. It 
consists of a small number of practices, the practices that are presented 
and discussed in this book. But these practices are not “inborn.” In 
forty-five years of work as a consultant with a large number of executives 
in a wide variety of organizations—large and small; businesses, 
government agencies, labor unions, hospitals, universities, community 
services; American, European, Latin American and Japanese—I have 
not come across a single “natural”: an executive who was born effective. 
All the effective ones have had to learn to be effective. And all of 
them then had to practice effectiveness until it became habit. But all 
the ones who worked on making themselves effective executives succeeded 
in doing so. Effectiveness can be learned—and it also has to be 
learned.

pair of shoes. We have learned how to measure efficiency and 
how to define quality in manual work during the last hundred 
years—to the point where we have been able to multiply the output 
of the individual worker tremendously. 
Formerly, the manual worker—whether machine operator or 
front-line soldier—predominated in all organizations. Few people 
of effectiveness were needed: those at the top who gave the 
orders that others carded out. They were so small a fraction of 
the total work population that we could, rightly or wrongly, take 
their effectiveness for granted. We could depend on the supply of 
“naturals,” the few people in any area of human endeavor who 
somehow know what the rest of us have to learn the hard way.

realize today that “government” during the American Civil 
War a hundred years ago meant the merest handful of people.

government buildings along the Mall today. 
The hospital of yesterday did not know any of the 
“health-service professionals,” the X-ray and lab technicians, 
the dieticians and therapists, the social workers, and so on, of 
whom it now employs as many as two hundred and fifty for 
every one hundred patients. Apart from a few nurses, there 
were only cleaning women, cooks, and maids. The physician 
was the knowledge worker, with the nurse as his aide. 
In other words, up to recent times, the major problem of 
organization was efficiency in the performance of the manual 
worker who did what he had been told to do. Knowledge 
workers were not predominant in organization. 
In fact, only a small fraction of the knowledge workers of 
earlier days were part of an organization. Most of them worked 
by themselves as professionals, at best with a clerk. Their effectiveness 
or lack of effectiveness concerned only themselves and 
affected only themselves. 
Today, however, the large knowledge organization is the central 
reality. Modern society is a society of large organized institutions. 
In every one of them, including the armed services, the 
center of gravity has shifted to the knowledge worker, the man 
who puts to work what he has between his ears rather than the 
brawn of his muscles or the skill of his hands. Increasingly, the 
majority of people who have been schooled to use knowledge, 
theory, and concept rather than physical force or manual skill 
work in an organization and are effective insofar as they can 
make a contribution to the organization. 
Now effectiveness can no longer be taken for granted. Now it 
can no longer be neglected.

are few things less pleasing to the Lord, and less productive, than 
an engineering department that rapidly turns out beautiful blueprints 
for the wrong product. Working on the right things is 
what makes knowledge work effective. This is not capable of 
being measured by any of the yardsticks for manual work. 
The knowledge worker cannot be supervised closely or in 
detail. He can only be helped. But he must direct himself, and he 
must direct himself toward performance and contribution, that 
is, toward effectiveness.

is meaningless data. The knowledge worker, therefore, must do 
something which a manual worker need not do. He must provide 
effectiveness. He cannot depend on the utility his output 
carries with it as does a well-made pair of shoes. 
The knowledge worker is the one “factor of production” 
through which the highly developed societies and economies of 
today—the United States, Western Europe, Japan, and also 
increasingly, the Soviet Union—become and remain competitive. 
• This is particularly true of the United States. The only resource in 
respect to which America can possibly have a competitive 
advantage is education. American education may leave a 
good deal to be desired, but it is massive beyond anything 
poorer societies can afford. For education is the most expensive 
capital investment we have ever known. A Ph.D. in the 
natural sciences represents $100,000 to $200,000 of social 
capital investment. Even the boy who graduates from college 
without any specific professional competence represents an 
investment of $50,000 or more. This only a very rich society 
can afford. 
Education is the one area, therefore, in which the richest 
of all societies, the United States, has a genuine advantage— 
provided it can make the knowledge worker productive. And 
productivity for the knowledge worker means the ability to 
get the right things done. It means effectiveness. 
WHO IS AN EXECUTIVE? 
Every knowledge worker in modern organization is an “executive” 
if, by virtue of his position or knowledge, he is responsible 
for a contribution that materially affects the capacity of the 
organization to perform and to obtain results, This may be the 
capacity of a business to bring out a new product or to obtain a 
E F F ECTI V ENE S S CAN B E L E A RNED 5?
6
larger share of a given market. It may be the capacity of a hospital 
to provide bedside care to its patients, and so on. Such a man 
(or woman) must make decisions; he cannot just carry out 
orders. He must take responsibility for his contribution. And he 
is supposed, by virtue of his knowledge, to be better equipped to 
make the right decision than anyone else. He may be overridden; 
he may be demoted or fired. But so long as he has the job the 
goals, the standards, and the contribution are in his keeping. 
Most managers are executives—though not all. But many 
nonmanagers are also becoming executives in modern society. 
For the knowledge organization, as we have been learning these 
last few years, needs both “managers” and “individual professional 
contributors” in positions of responsibility, decision-making, 
and authority. 
This fact is perhaps best illustrated by a recent newspaper 
interview with a young American infantry captain in the 
Vietnam jungle. 
• Asked by the reporter, “How in this confused situation can 
you retain command?” the young captain said: “Around 
here, I am only the guy who is responsible. If these men don’t 
know what to do when they run into an enemy in the jungle, 
I’m too far away to tell them. My job is to make sure they 
know. What they do depends on the situation which only 
they can judge. The responsibility is always mine, but the 
decision lies with whoever is on the spot.” 
In a guerrilla war, every man is an “executive.” 
There are many managers who are not executives. Many people, 
in other words, are superiors of other people—and often of 
fairly large numbers of other people—and still do not seriously 
affect the ability of the organization to perform. Most foremen 
in a manufacturing plant belong here. They are “overseers” in the 
literal sense of the word. 

Preface 
Management books usually deal with managing other people. The 
subject of this book is managing oneself for effectiveness. That one can 
truly manage other people is by no means adequately proven. But one 
can always manage oneself. Indeed, executives who do not manage 
themselves for effectiveness cannot possibly expect to manage their 
associates and subordinates. Management is largely by example. 
Executives who do not know how to make themselves effective in their 
own job and work set the wrong example. 
To be reasonably effective it is not enough for the individual to be 
intelligent, to work hard or to be knowledgeable. Effectiveness is something 
separate, something different. But to be effective also does not 
require special gifts, special aptitude, or special training. Effectiveness 
as an executive demands doing certain—and fairly simple—things. It 
consists of a small number of practices, the practices that are presented 
and discussed in this book. But these practices are not “inborn.” In 
forty-five years of work as a consultant with a large number of executives 
in a wide variety of organizations—large and small; businesses, 
government agencies, labor unions, hospitals, universities, community 
services; American, European, Latin American and Japanese—I have 
not come across a single “natural”: an executive who was born effective. 
All the effective ones have had to learn to be effective. And all of 
them then had to practice effectiveness until it became habit. But all 
the ones who worked on making themselves effective executives succeeded 
in doing so. Effectiveness can be learned—and it also has to be 
learned. 
Effectiveness is what executives are being paid for, whether they 
work as managers who are responsible for the performance of others as?
viii 
well as their own, or as individual professional contributors responsible 
for their own performance only. Without effectiveness there is no “performance,” 
no matter how much intelligence and knowledge goes into 
the work, no matter how many hours it takes. Yet it is perhaps not too 
surprising that we have so far paid little attention to the effective executive. 
Organizations—whether business enterprises, large government 
agencies, labor unions, large hospitals or large universities—are, after 
all, brand new. A century ago almost no one had even much contact 
with such organizations beyond an occasional trip to the local post 
office to mail a letter. And effectiveness as an executive means effectiveness 
in and through an organization. Until recently there was little 
reason for anyone to pay much attention to the effective executive or 
to worry about the low effectiveness of so many of them. Now, however, 
most people—especially those with even a fair amount of schooling—
can expect to spend all their working lives in an organization of 
some kind. Society has become a society of organizations in all developed 
countries. Now the effectiveness of the individual depends 
increasingly on his or her ability to be effective in an organization, to 
be effective as an executive. And the effectiveness of a modern society 
and its ability to perform—perhaps even its ability to survive—depend 
increasingly on the effectiveness of the people who work as executives 
in the organizations. The effective executive is fast becoming a key 
resource for society, and effectiveness as an executive a prime requirement 
for individual accomplishment and achievement—for young 
people at the beginning of their working lives fully as much as for people 
in mid-career.

1: Effectiveness Can Be 
Learned 
To be effective is the job of the executive. “To effect” and “to execute” 
are, after all, near-synonyms. Whether he works in a business 
or in a hospital, in a government agency or in a labor union, 
in a university or in the army, the executive is, first of all, 
expected to get the right things done. And this is simply that he is 
expected to be effective. 
Yet men of high effectiveness are conspicuous by their 
absence in executive jobs. High intelligence is common enough 
among executives. Imagination is far from rare. The level of 
knowledge tends to be high. But there seems to be little correlation 
between a man’s effectiveness and his intelligence, his imagination 
or his knowledge. Brilliant men are often strikingly ineffectual; 
they fail to realize that the brilliant insight is not by itself 
achievement. They never have learned that insights become 
effectiveness only through hard systematic work. Conversely, in 
every organization there are some highly effective plodders. 
While others rush around in the frenzy and busyness which very 
bright people so often confuse with “creativity,” the plodder puts 
one foot in front of the other and gets there first, like the tortoise 
in the old fable. 
Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential 
resources, but only effectiveness converts them into results. By 
themselves, they only set limits to what can be attained.

WHY WE NEED EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVES 
All this should be obvious. But why then has so little attention 
been paid to effectiveness, in an age in which there are 
mountains of books and articles on every other aspect of the 
executive’s tasks? 
One reason for this neglect is that effectiveness is the specific 
technology of the knowledge worker within an organization. 
Until recently, there was no more than a handful of these 
around. 
For manual work, we need only efficiency; that is, the ability 
to do things right rather than the ability to get the right things 
done. The manual worker can always be judged in terms of the 
quantity and quality of a definable and discrete output, such as a 
pair of shoes. We have learned how to measure efficiency and 
how to define quality in manual work during the last hundred

poorer societies can afford. For education is the most expensive 
capital investment we have ever known. A Ph.D. in the 
natural sciences represents $100,000 to $200,000 of social 
capital investment. Even the boy who graduates from college 
without any specific professional competence represents an 
investment of $50,000 or more. This only a very rich society 
can afford. 
Education is the one area, therefore, in which the richest 
of all societies, the United States, has a genuine advantage— 
provided it can make the knowledge worker productive. And 
productivity for the knowledge worker means the ability to 
get the right things done. It means effectiveness. 
WHO IS AN EXECUTIVE? 
Every knowledge worker in modern organization is an “executive” 
if, by virtue of his position or knowledge, he is responsible 
for a contribution that materially affects the capacity of the 
organization to perform and to obtain results, This may be the 
capacity of a business to bring out a new product or to obtain a 
E F F ECTI V ENE S S CAN B E L E A RNED 5?

larger share of a given market. It may be the capacity of a hospital 
to provide bedside care to its patients, and so on. Such a man 
(or woman) must make decisions; he cannot just carry out 
orders. He must take responsibility for his contribution. And he 
is supposed, by virtue of his knowledge, to be better equipped to 
make the right decision than anyone else. He may be overridden; 
he may be demoted or fired. But so long as he has the job the 
goals, the standards, and the contribution are in his keeping. 
Most managers are executives—though not all. But many 
nonmanagers are also becoming executives in modern society. 
For the knowledge organization, as we have been learning these 
last few years, needs both “managers” and “individual professional 
contributors” in positions of responsibility, decision-making, 
and authority. 
This fact is perhaps best illustrated by a recent newspaper 
interview with a young American infantry captain in the 
Vietnam jungle. 
• Asked by the reporter, “How in this confused situation can 
you retain command?” the young captain said: “Around 
here, I am only the guy who is responsible. If these men don’t 
know what to do when they run into an enemy in the jungle, 
I’m too far away to tell them. My job is to make sure they 
know. What they do depends on the situation which only 
they can judge. The responsibility is always mine, but the 
decision lies with whoever is on the spot.” 
In a guerrilla war, every man is an “executive.” 
There are many managers who are not executives. Many people, 
in other words, are superiors of other people—and often of 
fairly large numbers of other people—and still do not seriously 
affect the ability of the organization to perform. Most foremen 
in a manufacturing plant belong here. They are “overseers” in the 
literal sense of the word. 

Preface 
Management books usually deal with managing other people. The 
subject of this book is managing oneself for effectiveness. That one can 
truly manage other people is by no means adequately proven. But one 
can always manage oneself. Indeed, executives who do not manage 
themselves for effectiveness cannot possibly expect to manage their 
associates and subordinates. Management is largely by example. 
Executives who do not know how to make themselves effective in their 
own job and work set the wrong example. 
To be reasonably effective it is not enough for the individual to be 
intelligent, to work hard or to be knowledgeable. Effectiveness is something 
separate, something different. But to be effective also does not 
require special gifts, special aptitude, or special training. Effectiveness 
as an executive demands doing certain—and fairly simple—things. It 
consists of a small number of practices, the practices that are presented 
and discussed in this book. But these practices are not “inborn.” In 
forty-five years of work as a consultant with a large number of executives 
in a wide variety of organizations—large and small; businesses, 
government agencies, labor unions, hospitals, universities, community 
services; American, European, Latin American and Japanese—I have 
not come across a single “natural”: an executive who was born effective. 
All the effective ones have had to learn to be effective. And all of 
them then had to practice effectiveness until it became habit. But all 
the ones who worked on making themselves effective executives succeeded 
in doing so. Effectiveness can be learned—and it also has to be 
learned. 
Effectiveness is what executives are being paid for, whether they 
work as managers who are responsible for the performance of others as?
viii 
well as their own, or as individual professional contributors responsible 
for their own performance only. Without effectiveness there is no “performance,” 
no matter how much intelligence and knowledge goes into 
the work, no matter how many hours it takes. Yet it is perhaps not too 
surprising that we have so far paid little attention to the effective executive. 
Organizations—whether business enterprises, large government 
agencies, labor unions, large hospitals or large universities—are, after 
all, brand new. A century ago almost no one had even much contact 
with such organizations beyond an occasional trip to the local post 
office to mail a letter. And effectiveness as an executive means effectiveness 
in and through an organization. Until recently there was little 
reason for anyone to pay much attention to the effective executive or 
to worry about the low effectiveness of so many of them. Now, however, 
most people—especially those with even a fair amount of schooling—
can expect to spend all their working lives in an organization of 
some kind. Society has become a society of organizations in all developed 
countries. Now the effectiveness of the individual depends 
increasingly on his or her ability to be effective in an organization, to 
be effective as an executive. And the effectiveness of a modern society 
and its ability to perform—perhaps even its ability to survive—depend 
increasingly on the effectiveness of the people who work as executives 
in the organizations. The effective executive is fast becoming a key 
resource for society, and effectiveness as an executive a prime requirement 
for individual accomplishment and achievement—for young 
people at the beginning of their working lives fully as much as for people 
in mid-career.

1: Effectiveness Can Be 
Learned 
To be effective is the job of the executive. “To effect” and “to execute” 
are, after all, near-synonyms. Whether he works in a business 
or in a hospital, in a government agency or in a labor union, 
in a university or in the army, the executive is, first of all, 
expected to get the right things done. And this is simply that he is 
expected to be effective. 
Yet men of high effectiveness are conspicuous by their 
absence in executive jobs. High intelligence is common enough 
among executives. Imagination is far from rare. The level of 
knowledge tends to be high. But there seems to be little correlation 
between a man’s effectiveness and his intelligence, his imagination 
or his knowledge. Brilliant men are often strikingly ineffectual; 
they fail to realize that the brilliant insight is not by itself 
achievement. They never have learned that insights become 
effectiveness only through hard systematic work. Conversely, in 
every organization there are some highly effective plodders. 
While others rush around in the frenzy and busyness which very 
bright people so often confuse with “creativity,” the plodder puts 
one foot in front of the other and gets there first, like the tortoise 
in the old fable. 
Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential 
resources, but only effectiveness converts them into results. By 
themselves, they only set limits to what can be attained.

WHY WE NEED EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVES 
All this should be obvious. But why then has so little attention 
been paid to effectiveness, in an age in which there are 
mountains of books and articles on every other aspect of the 
executive’s tasks? 
One reason for this neglect is that effectiveness is the specific 
technology of the knowledge worker within an organization. 
Until recently, there was no more than a handful of these 
around. 
For manual work, we need only efficiency; that is, the ability 
to do things right rather than the ability to get the right things 
done. The manual worker can always be judged in terms of the 
quantity and quality of a definable and discrete output, such as a 
pair of shoes. We have learned how to measure efficiency and 
how to define quality in manual work during the last hundred 
years—to the point where we have been able to multiply the output 
of the individual worker tremendously. 
Formerly, the manual worker—whether machine operator or 
front-line soldier—predominated in all organizations. Few people 
of effectiveness were needed: those at the top who gave the 
orders that others carded out. They were so small a fraction of 
the total work population that we could, rightly or wrongly, take 
their effectiveness for granted. We could depend on the supply of 
“naturals,” the few people in any area of human endeavor who 
somehow know what the rest of us have to learn the hard way. 
• This was true not only of business and the army. It is hard to 
realize today that “government” during the American Civil 
War a hundred years ago meant the merest handful of people. 
Lincoln’s Secretary of War had fewer than fifty civilian 
subordinates, most of them not “executives” and policy-makers 
but telegraph clerks. The entire Washington establishment 
of the U.S. government in Theodore Roosevelt’s time, 
THE EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVE?
around 1900, could be comfortably housed in any one of the 
government buildings along the Mall today. 
The hospital of yesterday did not know any of the 
“health-service professionals,” the X-ray and lab technicians, 
the dieticians and therapists, the social workers, and so on, of 
whom it now employs as many as two hundred and fifty for 
every one hundred patients. Apart from a few nurses, there 
were only cleaning women, cooks, and maids. The physician 
was the knowledge worker, with the nurse as his aide. 
In other words, up to recent times, the major problem of 
organization was efficiency in the performance of the manual 
worker who did what he had been told to do. Knowledge 
workers were not predominant in organization. 
In fact, only a small fraction of the knowledge workers of 
earlier days were part of an organization. Most of them worked 
by themselves as professionals, at best with a clerk. Their effectiveness 
or lack of effectiveness concerned only themselves and 
affected only themselves. 
Today, however, the large knowledge organization is the central 
reality. Modern society is a society of large organized institutions. 
In every one of them, including the armed services, the 
center of gravity has shifted to the knowledge worker, the man 
who puts to work what he has between his ears rather than the 
brawn of his muscles or the skill of his hands. Increasingly, the 
majority of people who have been schooled to use knowledge, 
theory, and concept rather than physical force or manual skill 
work in an organization and are effective insofar as they can 
make a contribution to the organization. 
Now effectiveness can no longer be taken for granted. Now it 
can no longer be neglected. 
The imposing system of measurements and tests which we 
have developed for manual work—from industrial engineering 
E F F ECTI V ENE S S CAN B E L E A RNED 3?
4
to quality control—is not applicable to knowledge work. There 
are few things less pleasing to the Lord, and less productive, than 
an engineering department that rapidly turns out beautiful blueprints 
for the wrong product. Working on the right things is 
what makes knowledge work effective. This is not capable of 
being measured by any of the yardsticks for manual work. 
The knowledge worker cannot be supervised closely or in 
detail. He can only be helped. But he must direct himself, and he 
must direct himself toward performance and contribution, that 
is, toward effectiveness. 
• A cartoon in The New Yorker magazine some time ago showed an 
office on the door of which was the legend: Chas. Smith, 
General Sales Manager, Ajax Soap Company. The walls were 
bare except for a big sign saying Think. The man in the 
office had his feet propped up on his desk and was blowing

Preface 
Management books usually deal with managing other people. The 
subject of this book is managing oneself for effectiveness. That one can 
truly manage other people is by no means adequately proven. But one 
can always manage oneself. Indeed, executives who do not manage 
themselves for effectiveness cannot possibly expect to manage their 
associates and subordinates. Management is largely by example. 
Executives who do not know how to make themselves effective in their 
own job and work set the wrong example. 
To be reasonably effective it is not enough for the individual to be 
intelligent, to work hard or to be knowledgeable. Effectiveness is something 
separate, something different. But to be effective also does not 
require special gifts, special aptitude, or special training. Effectiveness 
as an executive demands doing certain—and fairly simple—things. It 
consists of a small number of practices, the practices that are presented 
and discussed in this book. But these practices are not “inborn.” In 
forty-five years of work as a consultant with a large number of executives 
in a wide variety of organizations—large and small; businesses, 
government agencies, labor unions, hospitals, universities, community 
services; American, European, Latin American and Japanese—I have 
not come across a single “natural”: an executive who was born effective. 
All the effective ones have had to learn to be effective. And all of 
them then had to practice effectiveness until it became habit. But all 
the ones who worked on making themselves effective executives succeeded 
in doing so. Effectiveness can be learned—and it also has to be 
learned. 
Effectiveness is what executives are being paid for, whether they 
work as managers who are responsible for the performance of others as?
viii 
well as their own, or as individual professional contributors responsible 
for their own performance only. Without effectiveness there is no “performance,” 
no matter how much intelligence and knowledge goes into 
the work, no matter how many hours it takes. Yet it is perhaps not too 
surprising that we have so far paid little attention to the effective executive. 
Organizations—whether business enterprises, large government 
agencies, labor unions, large hospitals or large universities—are, after 
all, brand new. A century ago almost no one had even much contact 
with such organizations beyond an occasional trip to the local post 
office to mail a letter. And effectiveness as an executive means effectiveness 
in and through an organization. Until recently there was little 
reason for anyone to pay much attention to the effective executive or 
to worry about the low effectiveness of so many of them. Now, however, 
most people—especially those with even a fair amount of schooling—
can expect to spend all their working lives in an organization of 
some kind. Society has become a society of organizations in all developed 
countries. Now the effectiveness of the individual depends 
increasingly on his or her ability to be effective in an organization, to 
be effective as an executive. And the effectiveness of a modern society 
and its ability to perform—perhaps even its ability to survive—depend 
increasingly on the effectiveness of the people who work as executives 
in the organizations. The effective executive is fast becoming a key 
resource for society, and effectiveness as an executive a prime requirement 
for individual accomplishment and achievement—for young 
people at the beginning of their working lives fully as much as for people 
in mid-career.

1: Effectiveness Can Be 
Learned 
To be effective is the job of the executive. “To effect” and “to execute” 
are, after all, near-synonyms. Whether he works in a business 
or in a hospital, in a government agency or in a labor union, 
in a university or in the army, the executive is, first of all, 
expected to get the right things done. And this is simply that he is 
expected to be effective. 
Yet men of high effectiveness are conspicuous by their 
absence in executive jobs. High intelligence is common enough 
among executives. Imagination is far from rare. The level of 
knowledge tends to be high. But there seems to be little correlation 
between a man’s effectiveness and his intelligence, his imagination 
or his knowledge. Brilliant men are often strikingly ineffectual; 
they fail to realize that the brilliant insight is not by itself 
achievement. They never have learned that insights become 
effectiveness only through hard systematic work. Conversely, in 
every organization there are some highly effective plodders. 
While others rush around in the frenzy and busyness which very 
bright people so often confuse with “creativity,” the plodder puts 
one foot in front of the other and gets there first, like the tortoise 
in the old fable. 
Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential 
resources, but only effectiveness converts them into results. By 
themselves, they only set limits to what can be attained.

WHY WE NEED EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVES 
All this should be obvious. But why then has so little attention 
been paid to effectiveness, in an age in which there are 
mountains of books and articles on every other aspect of the 
executive’s tasks? 
One reason for this neglect is that effectiveness is the specific 
technology of the knowledge worker within an organization. 
Until recently, there was no more than a handful of these 
around. 
For manual work, we need only efficiency; that is, the ability 
to do things right rather than the ability to get the right things 
done. The manual worker can always be judged in terms of the 
quantity and quality of a definable and discrete output, such as a 
pair of shoes. We have learned how to measure efficiency and 
how to define quality in manual work during the last hundred 
years—to the point where we have been able to multiply the output 
of the individual worker tremendously. 
Formerly, the manual worker—whether machine operator or 
front-line soldier—predominated in all organizations. Few people 
of effectiveness were needed: those at the top who gave the 
orders that others carded out. They were so small a fraction of 
the total work population that we could, rightly or wrongly, take 
their effectiveness for granted. We could depend on the supply of 
“naturals,” the few people in any area of human endeavor who 
somehow know what the rest of us have to learn the hard way. 
• This was true not only of business and the army. It is hard to 
realize today that “government” during the American Civil 
War a hundred years ago meant the merest handful of people. 
Lincoln’s Secretary of War had fewer than fifty civilian 
subordinates, most of them not “executives” and policy-makers 
but telegraph clerks. The entire Washington establishment 
of the U.S. government in Theodore Roosevelt’s time, 
THE EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVE?
around 1900, could be comfortably housed in any one of the 
government buildings along the Mall today. 
The hospital of yesterday did not know any of the 
“health-service professionals,” the X-ray and lab technicians, 
the dieticians and therapists, the social workers, and so on, of 
whom it now employs as many as two hundred and fifty for 
every one hundred patients. Apart from a few nurses, there 
were only cleaning women, cooks, and maids. The physician 
was the knowledge worker, with the nurse as his aide. 
In other words, up to recent times, the major problem of 
organization was efficiency in the performance of the manual 
worker who did what he had been told to do. Knowledge 
workers were not predominant in organization. 
In fact, only a small fraction of the knowledge workers of 
earlier days were part of an organization. Most of them worked 
by themselves as professionals, at best with a clerk. Their effectiveness 
or lack of effectiveness concerned only themselves and 
affected only themselves. 
Today, however, the large knowledge organization is the central 
reality. Modern society is a society of large organized institutions. 
In every one of them, including the armed services, the 
center of gravity has shifted to the knowledge worker, the man 
who puts to work what he has between his ears rather than the 
brawn of his muscles or the skill of his hands. Increasingly, the 
majority of people who have been schooled to use knowledge, 
theory, and concept rather than physical force or manual skill 
work in an organization and are effective insofar as they can 
make a contribution to the organization. 
Now effectiveness can no longer be taken for granted. Now it 
can no longer be neglected. 
The imposing system of measurements and tests which we 
have developed for manual work—from industrial engineering 
E F F ECTI V ENE S S CAN B E L E A RNED 3?
4
to quality control—is not applicable to knowledge work. There 
are few things less pleasing to the Lord, and less productive, than 
an engineering department that rapidly turns out beautiful blueprints 
for the wrong product. Working on the right things is 
what makes knowledge work effective. This is not capable of 
being measured by any of the yardsticks for manual work. 
The knowledge worker cannot be supervised closely or in 
detail. He can only be helped. But he must direct himself, and he 
must direct himself toward performance and contribution, that 
is, toward effectiveness. 
• A cartoon in The New Yorker magazine some time ago showed an 
office on the door of which was the legend: Chas. Smith, 
General Sales Manager, Ajax Soap Company. The walls were 
bare except for a big sign saying Think. The man in the 
office had his feet propped up on his desk and was blowing 
smoke rings at the ceiling. Outside two older men went by, 
the one saying to the other: “But how can we be sure that 
Smith thinks soap?” 
One can indeed never be sure what the knowledge worker 
thinks—and yet thinking is his specific work; it is his “doing.” 
The motivation of the knowledge worker depends on his 
* If effectiveness is 
lacking in his work, his commitment to work and to contribution 
will soon wither, and he will become a time-server going 
through the motions from 9 to 5. 
The knowledge worker does not produce something that is 
effective by itself. He does not produce a physical product —a 
ditch, a pair of shoes, a machine part. He produces knowledge, 
ideas, information. By themselves these “products” are useless. 
Somebody else, another man of knowledge, has to take them as 
his input and convert them into his output before they have any 
reality. The greatest wisdom not applied to action and behavior

is meaningless data. The knowledge worker, therefore, must do 
something which a manual worker need not do. He must provide 
effectiveness. He cannot depend on the utility his output 
carries with it as does a well-made pair of shoes. 
The knowledge worker is the one “factor of production” 
through which the highly developed societies and economies of 
today—the United States, Western Europe, Japan, and also 
increasingly, the Soviet Union—become and remain competitive. 
• This is particularly true of the United States. The only resource in 
respect to which America can possibly have a competitive 
advantage is education. American education may leave a 
good deal to be desired, but it is massive beyond anything 
poorer societies can afford. For education is the most expensive 
capital investment we have ever known. A Ph.D. in the 
natural sciences represents $100,000 to $200,000 of social 
capital investment. Even the boy who graduates from college 
without any specific professional competence represents an 
investment of $50,000 or more. This only a very rich society 
can afford. 
Education is the one area, therefore, in which the richest 
of all societies, the United States, has a genuine advantage— 
provided it can make the knowledge worker productive. And 
productivity for the knowledge worker means the ability to 
get the right things done. It means effectiveness. 
WHO IS AN EXECUTIVE? 
Every knowledge worker in modern organization is an “executive” 
if, by virtue of his position or knowledge, he is responsible 
for a contribution that materially affects the capacity of the 
organization to perform and to obtain results, This may be the 
capacity of a business to bring out a new product or to obtain a 
E F F ECTI V ENE S S CAN B E L E A RNED 5?
6
larger share of a given market. It may be the capacity of a hospital 
to provide bedside care to its patients, and so on. Such a man 
(or woman) must make decisions; he cannot just carry out 
orders. He must take responsibility for his contribution. And he 
is supposed, by virtue of his knowledge, to be better equipped to 
make the right decision than anyone else. He may be overridden; 
he may be demoted or fired. But so long as he has the job the 
goals, the standards, and the contribution are in his keeping. 
Most managers are executives—though not all. But many 
nonmanagers are also becoming executives in modern society. 
For the knowledge organization, as we have been learning these 
last few years, needs both “managers” and “individual professional 
contributors” in positions of responsibility, decision-making, 
and authority. 
This fact is perhaps best illustrated by a recent newspaper 
interview with a young American infantry captain in the 
Vietnam jungle. 
• Asked by the reporter, “How in this confused situation can 
you retain command?” the young captain said: “Around 
here, I am only the guy who is responsible. If these men don’t 
know what to do when they run into an enemy in the jungle, 
I’m too far away to tell them. My job is to make sure they 
know. What they do depends on the situation which only 
they can judge. The responsibility is always mine, but the 
decision lies with whoever is on the spot.”

1: Effectiveness Can Be 
Learned 
To be effective is the job of the executive. “To effect” and “to execute” 
are, after all, near-synonyms. Whether he works in a business 
or in a hospital, in a government agency or in a labor union, 
in a university or in the army, the executive is, first of all, 
expected to get the right things done. And this is simply that he is 
expected to be effective. 
Yet men of high effectiveness are conspicuous by their 
absence in executive jobs. High intelligence is common enough 
among executives. Imagination is far from rare. The level of 
knowledge tends to be high. But there seems to be little correlation 
between a man’s effectiveness and his intelligence, his imagination 
or his knowledge. Brilliant men are often strikingly ineffectual; 
they fail to realize that the brilliant insight is not by itself 
achievement. They never have learned that insights become 
effectiveness only through hard systematic work. Conversely, in 
every organization there are some highly effective plodders. 
While others rush around in the frenzy and busyness which very 
bright people so often confuse with “creativity,” the plodder puts 
one foot in front of the other and gets there first, like the tortoise 
in the old fable. 
Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential 
resources, but only effectiveness converts them into results. By 
themselves, they only set limits to what can be attained.

WHY WE NEED EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVES 
All this should be obvious. But why then has so little attention 
been paid to effectiveness, in an age in which there are 
mountains of books and articles on every other aspect of the 
executive’s tasks? 
One reason for this neglect is that effectiveness is the specific 
technology of the knowledge worker within an organization. 
Until recently, there was no more than a handful of these 
around. 
For manual work, we need only efficiency; that is, the ability 
to do things right rather than the ability to get the right things 
done. The manual worker can always be judged in terms of the 
quantity and quality of a definable and discrete output, such as a 
pair of shoes. We have learned how to measure efficiency and 
how to define quality in manual work during the last hundred 
years—to the point where we have been able to multiply the output 
of the individual worker tremendously. 
Formerly, the manual worker—whether machine operator or 
front-line soldier—predominated in all organizations. Few people 
of effectiveness were needed: those at the top who gave the 
orders that others carded out. They were so small a fraction of 
the total work population that we could, rightly or wrongly, take 
their effectiveness for granted. We could depend on the supply of 
“naturals,” the few people in any area of human endeavor who 
somehow know what the rest of us have to learn the hard way. 
• This was true not only of business and the army. It is hard to 
realize today that “government” during the American Civil 
War a hundred years ago meant the merest handful of people. 
Lincoln’s Secretary of War had fewer than fifty civilian 
subordinates, most of them not “executives” and policy-makers 
but telegraph clerks. The entire Washington establishment 
of the U.S. government in Theodore Roosevelt’s time, 
THE EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVE?
around 1900, could be comfortably housed in any one of the 
government buildings along the Mall today. 
The hospital of yesterday did not know any of the 
“health-service professionals,” the X-ray and lab technicians, 
the dieticians and therapists, the social workers, and so on, of 
whom it now employs as many as two hundred and fifty for 
every one hundred patients. Apart from a few nurses, there 
were only cleaning women, cooks, and maids. The physician 
was the knowledge worker, with the nurse as his aide. 
In other words, up to recent times, the major problem of 
organization was efficiency in the performance of the manual 
worker who did what he had been told to do. Knowledge 
workers were not predominant in organization. 
In fact, only a small fraction of the knowledge workers of 
earlier days were part of an organization. Most of them worked 
by themselves as professionals, at best with a clerk. Their effectiveness 
or lack of effectiveness concerned only themselves and 
affected only themselves. 
Today, however, the large knowledge organization is the central 
reality. Modern society is a society of large organized institutions. 
In every one of them, including the armed services, the 
center of gravity has shifted to the knowledge worker, the man 
who puts to work what he has between his ears rather than the 
brawn of his muscles or the skill of his hands. Increasingly, the 
majority of people who have been schooled to use knowledge, 
theory, and concept rather than physical force or manual skill 
work in an organization and are effective insofar as they can 
make a contribution to the organization. 
Now effectiveness can no longer be taken for granted. Now it 
can no longer be neglected. 
The imposing system of measurements and tests which we 
have developed for manual work—from industrial engineering 
E F F ECTI V ENE S S CAN B E L E A RNED 3?
4
to quality control—is not applicable to knowledge work. There 
are few things less pleasing to the Lord, and less productive, than 
an engineering department that rapidly turns out beautiful blueprints 
for the wrong product. Working on the right things is 
what makes knowledge work effective. This is not capable of 
being measured by any of the yardsticks for manual work. 
The knowledge worker cannot be supervised closely or in 
detail. He can only be helped. But he must direct himself, and he 
must direct himself toward performance and contribution, that 
is, toward effectiveness. 
• A cartoon in The New Yorker magazine some time ago showed an 
office on the door of which was the legend: Chas. Smith, 
General Sales Manager, Ajax Soap Company. The walls were 
bare except for a big sign saying Think. The man in the 
office had his feet propped up on his desk and was blowing 
smoke rings at the ceiling. Outside two older men went by, 
the one saying to the other: “But how can we be sure that 
Smith thinks soap?” 
One can indeed never be sure what the knowledge worker 
thinks—and yet thinking is his specific work; it is his “doing.” 
The motivation of the knowledge worker depends on his

lacking in his work, his commitment to work and to contribution 
will soon wither, and he will become a time-server going 
through the motions from 9 to 5. 
The knowledge worker does not produce something that is 
effective by itself. He does not produce a physical product —a 
ditch, a pair of shoes, a machine part. He produces knowledge, 
ideas, information. By themselves these “products” are useless. 
Somebody else, another man of knowledge, has to take them as 
his input and convert them into his output before they have any 
reality. The greatest wisdom not applied to action and behavior

is meaningless data. The knowledge worker, therefore, must do 
something which a manual worker need not do. He must provide 
effectiveness. He cannot depend on the utility his output 
carries with it as does a well-made pair of shoes. 
The knowledge worker is the one “factor of production” 
through which the highly developed societies and economies of 
today—the United States, Western Europe, Japan, and also 
increasingly, the Soviet Union—become and remain competitive. 
• This is particularly true of the United States. The only resource in 
respect to which America can possibly have a competitive 
advantage is education. American education may leave a 
good deal to be desired, but it is massive beyond anything 
poorer societies can afford. For education is the most expensive 
capital investment we have ever known. A Ph.D. in the 
natural sciences represents $100,000 to $200,000 of social 
capital investment. Even the boy who graduates from college 
without any specific professional competence represents an 
investment of $50,000 or more. This only a very rich society 
can afford. 
Education is the one area, therefore, in which the richest 
of all societies, the United States, has a genuine advantage— 
provided it can make the knowledge worker productive. And 
productivity for the knowledge worker means the ability to 
get the right things done. It means effectiveness. 
WHO IS AN EXECUTIVE? 
Every knowledge worker in modern organization is an “executive” 
if, by virtue of his position or knowledge, he is responsible 
for a contribution that materially affects the capacity of the 
organization to perform and to obtain results, This may be the 
capacity of a business to bring out a new product or to obtain a 
E F F ECTI V ENE S S CAN B E L E A RNED 5?
6
larger share of a given market. It may be the capacity of a hospital 
to provide bedside care to its patients, and so on. Such a man 
(or woman) must make decisions; he cannot just carry out 
orders. He must take responsibility for his contribution. And he 
is supposed, by virtue of his knowledge, to be better equipped to 
make the right decision than anyone else. He may be overridden; 
he may be demoted or fired. But so long as he has the job the 
goals, the standards, and the contribution are in his keeping. 
Most managers are executives—though not all. But many 
nonmanagers are also becoming executives in modern society. 
For the knowledge organization, as we have been learning these 
last few years, needs both “managers” and “individual professional 
contributors” in positions of responsibility, decision-making, 
and authority. 
This fact is perhaps best illustrated by a recent newspaper 
interview with a young American infantry captain in the 
Vietnam jungle. 
• Asked by the reporter, “How in this confused situation can 
you retain command?” the young captain said: “Around 
here, I am only the guy who is responsible. If these men don’t 
know what to do when they run into an enemy in the jungle, 
I’m too far away to tell them. My job is to make sure they 
know. What they do depends on the situation which only 
they can judge. The responsibility is always mine, but the 
decision lies with whoever is on the spot.” 
In a guerrilla war, every man is an “executive.” 
There are many managers who are not executives. Many people, 
in other words, are superiors of other people—and often of 
fairly large numbers of other people—and still do not seriously 
affect the ability of the organization to perform. Most foremen 
in a manufacturing plant belong here. They are “overseers” in the 
literal sense of the word. 

Preface 
Management books usually deal with managing other people. The 
subject of this book is managing oneself for effectiveness. That one can 
truly manage other people is by no means adequately proven. But one 
can always manage oneself. Indeed, executives who do not manage 
themselves for effectiveness cannot possibly expect to manage their 
associates and subordinates. Management is largely by example. 
Executives who do not know how to make themselves effective in their 
own job and work set the wrong example. 
To be reasonably effective it is not enough for the individual to be 
intelligent, to work hard or to be knowledgeable. Effectiveness is something 
separate, something different. But to be effective also does not 
require special gifts, special aptitude, or special training. Effectiveness 
as an executive demands doing certain—and fairly simple—things. It 
consists of a small number of practices, the practices that are presented 
and discussed in this book. But these practices are not “inborn.” In 
forty-five years of work as a consultant with a large number of executives 
in a wide variety of organizations—large and small; businesses, 
government agencies, labor unions, hospitals, universities, community 
services; American, European, Latin American and Japanese—I have 
not come across a single “natural”: an executive who was born effective. 
All the effective ones have had to learn to be effective. And all of 
them then had to practice effectiveness until it became habit. But all 
the ones who worked on making themselves effective executives succeeded 
in doing so. Effectiveness can be learned—and it also has to be 
learned. 
Effectiveness is what executives are being paid for, whether they 
work as managers who are responsible for the performance of others as?
viii 
well as their own, or as individual professional contributors responsible 
for their own performance only. Without effectiveness there is no “performance,” 
no matter how much intelligence and knowledge goes into 
the work, no matter how many hours it takes. Yet it is perhaps not too 
surprising that we have so far paid little attention to the effective executive. 
Organizations—whether business enterprises, large government 
agencies, labor unions, large hospitals or large universities—are, after 
all, brand new. A century ago almost no one had even much contact 
with such organizations beyond an occasional trip to the local post 
office to mail a letter. And effectiveness as an executive means effectiveness 
in and through an organization. Until recently there was little 
reason for anyone to pay much attention to the effective executive or 
to worry about the low effectiveness of so many of them. Now, however, 
most people—especially those with even a fair amount of schooling—
can expect to spend all their working lives in an organization of 
some kind. Society has become a society of organizations in all developed 
countries. Now the effectiveness of the individual depends 
increasingly on his or her ability to be effective in an organization, to 
be effective as an executive. And the effectiveness of a modern society 
and its ability to perform—perhaps even its ability to survive—depend 
increasingly on the effectiveness of the people who work as executives 
in the organizations. The effective executive is fast becoming a key 
resource for society, and effectiveness as an executive a prime requirement 
for individual accomplishment and achievement—for young 
people at the beginning of their working lives fully as much as for people 
in mid-career.

organization was efficiency in the performance of the manual 
worker who did what he had been told to do. Knowledge 
workers were not predominant in organization. 
In fact, only a small fraction of the knowledge workers of 
earlier days were part of an organization. Most of them worked 
by themselves as professionals, at best with a clerk. Their effectiveness 
or lack of effectiveness concerned only themselves and 
affected only themselves. 
Today, however, the large knowledge organization is the central 
reality. Modern society is a society of large organized institutions. 
In every one of them, including the armed services, the 
center of gravity has shifted to the knowledge worker, the man 
who puts to work what he has between his ears rather than the 
brawn of his muscles or the skill of his hands. Increasingly, the 
majority of people who have been schooled to use knowledge, 
theory, and concept rather than physical force or manual skill 
work in an organization and are effective insofar as they can 
make a contribution to the organization. 
Now effectiveness can no longer be taken for granted. Now it 
can no longer be neglected. 
The imposing system of measurements and tests which we 
have developed for manual work—from industrial engineering

to quality control—is not applicable to knowledge work. There 
are few things less pleasing to the Lord, and less productive, than 
an engineering department that rapidly turns out beautiful blueprints 
for the wrong product. Working on the right things is 
what makes knowledge work effective. This is not capable of 
being measured by any of the yardsticks for manual work. 
The knowledge worker cannot be supervised closely or in 
detail. He can only be helped. But he must direct himself, and he 
must direct himself toward performance and contribution, that 
is, toward effectiveness.

is meaningless data. The knowledge worker, therefore, must do 
something which a manual worker need not do. He must provide 
effectiveness. He cannot depend on the utility his output 
carries with it as does a well-made pair of shoes. 
The knowledge worker is the one “factor of production” 
through which the highly developed societies and economies of 
today—the United States, Western Europe, Japan, and also 
increasingly, the Soviet Union—become and remain competitive. 
• This is particularly true of the United States. The only resource in 
respect to which America can possibly have a competitive 
advantage is education. American education may leave a 
good deal to be desired, but it is massive beyond anything 
poorer societies can afford. For education is the most expensive 
capital investment we have ever known. A Ph.D. in the 
natural sciences represents $100,000 to $200,000 of social 
capital investment. Even the boy who graduates from college 
without any specific professional competence represents an 
investment of $50,000 or more. This only a very rich society 
can afford. 
Education is the one area, therefore, in which the richest 
of all societies, the United States, has a genuine advantage— 
provided it can make the knowledge worker productive. And 
productivity for the knowledge worker means the ability to 
get the right things done. It means effectiveness. 
WHO IS AN EXECUTIVE? 
Every knowledge worker in modern organization is an “executive” 
if, by virtue of his position or knowledge, he is responsible 
for a contribution that materially affects the capacity of the 
organization to perform and to obtain results, This may be the 
capacity of a business to bring out a new product or to obtain a 
E F F ECTI V ENE S S CAN B E L E A RNED 5?
6
larger share of a given market. It may be the capacity of a hospital 
to provide bedside care to its patients, and so on. Such a man 
(or woman) must make decisions; he cannot just carry out 
orders. He must take responsibility for his contribution. And he 
is supposed, by virtue of his knowledge, to be better equipped to 
make the right decision than anyone else. He may be overridden; 
he may be demoted or fired. But so long as he has the job the 
goals, the standards, and the contribution are in his keeping. 
Most managers are executives—though not all. But many 
nonmanagers are also becoming executives in modern society. 
For the knowledge organization, as we have been learning these 
last few years, needs both “managers” and “individual professional 
contributors” in positions of responsibility, decision-making, 
and authority. 
This fact is perhaps best illustrated by a recent newspaper 
interview with a young American infantry captain in the 
Vietnam jungle. 
• Asked by the reporter, “How in this confused situation can 
you retain command?” the young captain said: “Around 
here, I am only the guy who is responsible. If these men don’t 
know what to do when they run into an enemy in the jungle, 
I’m too far away to tell them. My job is to make sure they 
know. What they do depends on the situation which only 
they can judge. The responsibility is always mine, but the 
decision lies with whoever is on the spot.” 
In a guerrilla war, every man is an “executive.” 
There are many managers who are not executives. Many people, 
in other words, are superiors of other people—and often of 
fairly large numbers of other people—and still do not seriously 
affect the ability of the organization to perform. Most foremen 
in a manufacturing plant belong here. They are “overseers” in the 
literal sense of the word. 

Preface 
Management books usually deal with managing other people. The 
subject of this book is managing oneself for effectiveness. That one can 
truly manage other people is by no means adequately proven. But one 
can always manage oneself. Indeed, executives who do not manage 
themselves for effectiveness cannot possibly expect to manage their 
associates and subordinates. Management is largely by example. 
Executives who do not know how to make themselves effective in their 
own job and work set the wrong example. 
To be reasonably effective it is not enough for the individual to be 
intelligent, to work hard or to be knowledgeable. Effectiveness is something 
separate, something different. But to be effective also does not 
require special gifts, special aptitude, or special training. Effectiveness 
as an executive demands doing certain—and fairly simple—things. It 
consists of a small number of practices, the practices that are presented 
and discussed in this book. But these practices are not “inborn.” In 
forty-five years of work as a consultant with a large number of executives 
in a wide variety of organizations—large and small; businesses, 
government agencies, labor unions, hospitals, universities, community 
services; American, European, Latin American and Japanese—I have 
not come across a single “natural”: an executive who was born effective. 
All the effective ones have had to learn to be effective. And all of 
them then had to practice effectiveness until it became habit. But all 
the ones who worked on making themselves effective executives succeeded 
in doing so. Effectiveness can be learned—and it also has to be 
learned. 
Effectiveness is what executives are being paid for, whether they 
work as managers who are responsible for the performance of others as?
viii 
well as their own, or as individual professional contributors responsible 
for their own performance only. Without effectiveness there is no “performance,” 
no matter how much intelligence and knowledge goes into 
the work, no matter how many hours it takes. Yet it is perhaps not too 
surprising that we have so far paid little attention to the effective executive. 
Organizations—whether business enterprises, large government 
agencies, labor unions, large hospitals or large universities—are, after 
all, brand new. A century ago almost no one had even much contact 
with such organizations beyond an occasional trip to the local post 
office to mail a letter. And effectiveness as an executive means effectiveness 
in and through an organization. Until recently there was little 
reason for anyone to pay much attention to the effective executive or 
to worry about the low effectiveness of so many of them. Now, however, 
most people—especially those with even a fair amount of schooling—
can expect to spend all their working lives in an organization of 
some kind. Society has become a society of organizations in all developed 
countries. Now the effectiveness of the individual depends 
increasingly on his or her ability to be effective in an organization, to 
be effective as an executive. And the effectiveness of a modern society 
and its ability to perform—perhaps even its ability to survive—depend 
increasingly on the effectiveness of the people who work as executives 
in the organizations. The effective executive is fast becoming a key 
resource for society, and effectiveness as an executive a prime requirement 
for individual accomplishment and achievement—for young 
people at the beginning of their working lives fully as much as for people 
in mid-career.

1: Effectiveness Can Be 
Learned 
To be effective is the job of the executive. “To effect” and “to execute” 
are, after all, near-synonyms. Whether he works in a business 
or in a hospital, in a government agency or in a labor union, 
in a university or in the army, the executive is, first of all, 
expected to get the right things done. And this is simply that he is 
expected to be effective. 
Yet men of high effectiveness are conspicuous by their 
absence in executive jobs. High intelligence is common enough 
among executives. Imagination is far from rare. The level of 
knowledge tends to be high. But there seems to be little correlation 
between a man’s effectiveness and his intelligence, his imagination 
or his knowledge. Brilliant men are often strikingly ineffectual; 
they fail to realize that the brilliant insight is not by itself 
achievement. They never have learned that insights become 
effectiveness only through hard systematic work. Conversely, in 
every organization there are some highly effective plodders. 
While others rush around in the frenzy and busyness which very 
bright people so often confuse with “creativity,” the plodder puts 
one foot in front of the other and gets there first, like the tortoise 
in the old fable. 
Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential 
resources, but only effectiveness converts them into results. By 
themselves, they only set limits to what can be attained.

WHY WE NEED EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVES 
All this should be obvious. But why then has so little attention 
been paid to effectiveness, in an age in which there are 
mountains of books and articles on every other aspect of the 
executive’s tasks? 
One reason for this neglect is that effectiveness is the specific 
technology of the knowledge worker within an organization. 
Until recently, there was no more than a handful of these 
around. 
For manual work, we need only efficiency; that is, the ability 
to do things right rather than the ability to get the right things 
done. The manual worker can always be judged in terms of the 
quantity and quality of a definable and discrete output, such as a 
pair of shoes. We have learned how to measure efficiency and 
how to define quality in manual work during the last hundred 
years—to the point where we have been able to multiply the output 
of the individual worker tremendously. 
Formerly, the manual worker—whether machine operator or 
front-line soldier—predominated in all organizations. Few people 
of effectiveness were needed: those at the top who gave the 
orders that others carded out. They were so small a fraction of 
the total work population that we could, rightly or wrongly, take 
their effectiveness for granted. We could depend on the supply of 
“naturals,” the few people in any area of human endeavor who 
somehow know what the rest of us have to learn the hard way. 
• This was true not only of business and the army. It is hard to 
realize today that “government” during the American Civil 
War a hundred years ago meant the merest handful of people. 
Lincoln’s Secretary of War had fewer than fifty civilian 
subordinates, most of them not “executives” and policy-makers 
but telegraph clerks. The entire Washington establishment 
of the U.S. government in Theodore Roosevelt’s time, 
THE EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVE?
around 1900, could be comfortably housed in any one of the 
government buildings along the Mall today. 
The hospital of yesterday did not know any of the 
“health-service professionals,” the X-ray and lab technicians, 
the dieticians and therapists, the social workers, and so on, of 
whom it now employs as many as two hundred and fifty for 
every one hundred patients. Apart from a few nurses, there 
were only cleaning women, cooks, and maids. The physician 
was the knowledge worker, with the nurse as his aide. 
In other words, up to recent times, the major problem of 
organization was efficiency in the performance of the manual 
worker who did what he had been told to do. Knowledge 
workers were not predominant in organization. 
In fact, only a small fraction of the knowledge workers of

natural sciences represents $100,000 to $200,000 of social 
capital investment. Even the boy who graduates from college 
without any specific professional competence represents an 
investment of $50,000 or more. This only a very rich society 
can afford. 
Education is the one area, therefore, in which the richest 
of all societies, the United States, has a genuine advantage— 
provided it can make the knowledge worker productive. And 
productivity for the knowledge worker means the ability to 
get the right things done. It means effectiveness. 
WHO IS AN EXECUTIVE? 
Every knowledge worker in modern organization is an “executive” 
if, by virtue of his position or knowledge, he is responsible 
for a contribution that materially affects the capacity of the 
organization to perform and to obtain results, This may be the 
capacity of a business to bring out a new product or to obtain a

larger share of a given market. It may be the capacity of a hospital 
to provide bedside care to its patients, and so on. Such a man 
(or woman) must make decisions; he cannot just carry out 
orders. He must take responsibility for his contribution. And he 
is supposed, by virtue of his knowledge, to be better equipped to 
make the right decision than anyone else. He may be overridden; 
he may be demoted or fired. But so long as he has the job the 
goals, the standards, and the contribution are in his keeping. 
Most managers are executives—though not all. But many 
nonmanagers are also becoming executives in modern society. 
For the knowledge organization, as we have been learning these 
last few years, needs both “managers” and “individual professional 
contributors” in positions of responsibility, decision-making, 
and authority. 
This fact is perhaps best illustrated by a recent newspaper 
interview with a young American infantry captain in the 
Vietnam jungle. 
• Asked by the reporter, “How in this confused situation can 
you retain command?” the young captain said: “Around 
here, I am only the guy who is responsible. If these men don’t 
know what to do when they run into an enemy in the jungle, 
I’m too far away to tell them. My job is to make sure they 
know. What they do depends on the situation which only 
they can judge. The responsibility is always mine, but the 
decision lies with whoever is on the spot.” 
In a guerrilla war, every man is an “executive.” 
There are many managers who are not executives. Many people, 
in other words, are superiors of other people—and often of 
fairly large numbers of other people—and still do not seriously 
affect the ability of the organization to perform. Most foremen 
in a manufacturing plant belong here. They are “overseers” in the 
literal sense of the word. 

Preface 
Management books usually deal with managing other people. The 
subject of this book is managing oneself for effectiveness. That one can 
truly manage other people is by no means adequately proven. But one 
can always manage oneself. Indeed, executives who do not manage 
themselves for effectiveness cannot possibly expect to manage their 
associates and subordinates. Management is largely by example. 
Executives who do not know how to make themselves effective in their 
own job and work set the wrong example. 
To be reasonably effective it is not enough for the individual to be 
intelligent, to work hard or to be knowledgeable. Effectiveness is something 
separate, something different. But to be effective also does not 
require special gifts, special aptitude, or special training. Effectiveness 
as an executive demands doing certain—and fairly simple—things. It 
consists of a small number of practices, the practices that are presented 
and discussed in this book. But these practices are not “inborn.” In 
forty-five years of work as a consultant with a large number of executives 
in a wide variety of organizations—large and small; businesses, 
government agencies, labor unions, hospitals, universities, community 
services; American, European, Latin American and Japanese—I have 
not come across a single “natural”: an executive who was born effective. 
All the effective ones have had to learn to be effective. And all of 
them then had to practice effectiveness until it became habit. But all 
the ones who worked on making themselves effective executives succeeded 
in doing so. Effectiveness can be learned—and it also has to be 
learned. 
Effectiveness is what executives are being paid for, whether they 
work as managers who are responsible for the performance of others as?
viii 
well as their own, or as individual professional contributors responsible 
for their own performance only. Without effectiveness there is no “performance,” 
no matter how much intelligence and knowledge goes into 
the work, no matter how many hours it takes. Yet it is perhaps not too 
surprising that we have so far paid little attention to the effective executive. 
Organizations—whether business enterprises, large government 
agencies, labor unions, large hospitals or large universities—are, after 
all, brand new. A century ago almost no one had even much contact 
with such organizations beyond an occasional trip to the local post 
office to mail a letter. And effectiveness as an executive means effectiveness 
in and through an organization. Until recently there was little 
reason for anyone to pay much attention to the effective executive or 
to worry about the low effectiveness of so many of them. Now, however, 
most people—especially those with even a fair amount of schooling—
can expect to spend all their working lives in an organization of 
some kind. Society has become a society of organizations in all developed 
countries. Now the effectiveness of the individual depends 
increasingly on his or her ability to be effective in an organization, to 
be effective as an executive. And the effectiveness of a modern society 
and its ability to perform—perhaps even its ability to survive—depend 
increasingly on the effectiveness of the people who work as executives 
in the organizations. The effective executive is fast becoming a key 
resource for society, and effectiveness as an executive a prime requirement 
for individual accomplishment and achievement—for young 
people at the beginning of their working lives fully as much as for people 
in mid-career.

1: Effectiveness Can Be 
Learned 
To be effective is the job of the executive. “To effect” and “to execute” 
are, after all, near-synonyms. Whether he works in a business 
or in a hospital, in a government agency or in a labor union, 
in a university or in the army, the executive is, first of all, 
expected to get the right things done. And this is simply that he is 
expected to be effective. 
Yet men of high effectiveness are conspicuous by their 
absence in executive jobs. High intelligence is common enough 
among executives. Imagination is far from rare. The level of 
knowledge tends to be high. But there seems to be little correlation 
between a man’s effectiveness and his intelligence, his imagination 
or his knowledge. Brilliant men are often strikingly ineffectual; 
they fail to realize that the brilliant insight is not by itself 
achievement. They never have learned that insights become 
effectiveness only through hard systematic work. Conversely, in 
every organization there are some highly effective plodders. 
While others rush around in the frenzy and busyness which very 
bright people so often confuse with “creativity,” the plodder puts 
one foot in front of the other and gets there first, like the tortoise 
in the old fable. 
Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential 
resources, but only effectiveness converts them into results. By 
themselves, they only set limits to what can be attained.

WHY WE NEED EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVES 
All this should be obvious. But why then has so little attention 
been paid to effectiveness, in an age in which there are 
mountains of books and articles on every other aspect of the 
executive’s tasks? 
One reason for this neglect is that effectiveness is the specific 
technology of the knowledge worker within an organization. 
Until recently, there was no more than a handful of these 
around. 
For manual work, we need only efficiency; that is, the ability 
to do things right rather than the ability to get the right things 
done. The manual worker can always be judged in terms of the 
quantity and quality of a definable and discrete output, such as a 
pair of shoes. We have learned how to measure efficiency and 
how to define quality in manual work during the last hundred 
years—to the point where we have been able to multiply the output 
of the individual worker tremendously. 
Formerly, the manual worker—whether machine operator or 
front-line soldier—predominated in all organizations. Few people 
of effectiveness were needed: those at the top who gave the 
orders that others carded out. They were so small a fraction of 
the total work population that we could, rightly or wrongly, take 
their effectiveness for granted. We could depend on the supply of 
“naturals,” the few people in any area of human endeavor who 
somehow know what the rest of us have to learn the hard way. 
• This was true not only of business and the army. It is hard to 
realize today that “government” during the American Civil 
War a hundred years ago meant the merest handful of people. 
Lincoln’s Secretary of War had fewer than fifty civilian 
subordinates, most of them not “executives” and policy-makers 
but telegraph clerks. The entire Washington establishment 
of the U.S. government in Theodore Roosevelt’s time, 
THE EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVE?
around 1900, could be comfortably housed in any one of the 
government buildings along the Mall today. 
The hospital of yesterday did not know any of the 
“health-service professionals,” the X-ray and lab technicians, 
the dieticians and therapists, the social workers, and so on, of 
whom it now employs as many as two hundred and fifty for 
every one hundred patients. Apart from a few nurses, there 
were only cleaning women, cooks, and maids. The physician 
was the knowledge worker, with the nurse as his aide. 
In other words, up to recent times, the major problem of 
organization was efficiency in the performance of the manual 
worker who did what he had been told to do. Knowledge 
workers were not predominant in organization. 
In fact, only a small fraction of the knowledge workers of 
earlier days were part of an organization. Most of them worked 
by themselves as professionals, at best with a clerk. Their effectiveness 
or lack of effectiveness concerned only themselves and 
affected only themselves. 
Today, however, the large knowledge organization is the central 
reality. Modern society is a society of large organized institutions. 
In every one of them, including the armed services, the 
center of gravity has shifted to the knowledge worker, the man 
who puts to work what he has between his ears rather than the 
brawn of his muscles or the skill of his hands. Increasingly, the 
majority of people who have been schooled to use knowledge, 
theory, and concept rather than physical force or manual skill 
work in an organization and are effective insofar as they can 
make a contribution to the organization. 
Now effectiveness can no longer be taken for granted. Now it 
can no longer be neglected. 
The imposing system of measurements and tests which we 
have developed for manual work—from industrial engineering 
E F F ECTI V ENE S S CAN B E L E A RNED 3?
4
to quality control—is not applicable to knowledge work. There 
are few things less pleasing to the Lord, and less productive, than 
an engineering department that rapidly turns out beautiful blueprints 
for the wrong product. Working on the right things is 
what makes knowledge work effective. This is not capable of 
being measured by any of the yardsticks for manual work. 
The knowledge worker cannot be supervised closely or in 
detail. He can only be helped. But he must direct himself, and he 
must direct himself toward performance and contribution, that 
is, toward effectiveness. 
• A cartoon in The New Yorker magazine some time ago showed an 
office on the door of which was the legend: Chas. Smith, 
General Sales Manager, Ajax Soap Company. The walls were 
bare except for a big sign saying Think. The man in the 
office had his feet propped up on his desk and was blowing 
smoke rings at the ceiling. Outside two older men went by, 
the one saying to the other: “But how can we be sure that 
Smith thinks soap?” 
One can indeed never be sure what the knowledge worker 
thinks—and yet thinking is his specific work; it is his “doing.” 
The motivation of the knowledge worker depends on his 
* If effectiveness is 
lacking in his work, his commitment to work and to contribution 
will soon wither, and he will become a time-server going 
through the motions from 9 to 5. 
The knowledge worker does not produce something that is 
effective by itself. He does not produce a physical product —a 
ditch, a pair of shoes, a machine part. He produces knowledge, 
ideas, information. By themselves these “products” are useless. 
Somebody else, another man of knowledge, has to take them as 
his input and convert them into his output before they have any 
reality. The greatest wisdom not applied to action and behavior

is meaningless data. The knowledge worker, therefore, must do 
something which a manual worker need not do. He must provide 
effectiveness. He cannot depend on the utility his output 
carries with it as does a well-made pair of shoes. 
The knowledge worker is the one “factor of production” 
through which the highly developed societies and economies of 
today—the United States, Western Europe, Japan, and also 
increasingly, the Soviet Union—become and remain competitive. 
• This is particularly true of the United States. The only resource in 
respect to which America can possibly have a competitive 
advantage is education. American education may leave a 
good deal to be desired, but it is massive beyond anything 
poorer societies can afford. For education is the most expensive 
capital investment we have ever known. A Ph.D. in the 
natural sciences represents $100,000 to $200,000 of social 
capital investment. Even the boy who graduates from college 
without any specific professional competence represents an 
investment of $50,000 or more. This only a very rich society 
can afford. 
Education is the one area, therefore, in which the richest 
of all societies, the United States, has a genuine advantage— 
provided it can make the knowledge worker productive. And 
productivity for the knowledge worker means the ability to 
get the right things done. It means effectiveness.
